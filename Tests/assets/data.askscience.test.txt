Was looking for someone to mention this. Phage are used in Russia and I remember catching the end of an old documentary ABOUT it. they collected samples from the SEWAGE system and using that to cultivate phage to treat bacteria. There is a lot of distrust of former Soviet bloc science in the west (and VISA versa) so it hasn’t become mainstream. [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0478-4) is an article from Nature which is far more knowledgeable than me.

Everything in the world is afflicted by viruses, because viruses are less of a living pathogen and more of a self-propagating collection of Biomolecules that only exists because it is self-propagating. This seems like a tautology but because of mutation and random drift of BIOMOLECULES in general, viruses have a fairly good frequency of popping up. And once they do, they tend to Spread Quickly and stick around. [Viruses have probably been around since living things first existed.](https://zenodo.org/record/1259447#.YVbi7VMpAwA) There are viruses that infect every single living thing, because by biochemical definition they need to be able to develop wherever life can exist. They're made of the same basic components after all. [Even extremophiles, archaeobacteria living in the most extreme environments get viral infections.](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37966#:~:text=All%20known%20archaeal%20viruses%20infect,in%20bacteriophages%20or%20plant%20viruses.) As far as other pathogens go, prions (malignant deformed proteins) also afflict all plants and animals, since they're just malignant versions of naturally occurring biomolecules. My intuition tells me that they could exist in bacteria, [but research In that field is not super developed.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21293#:~:text=Until%20now%2C%20prions%20were%20only,such%20as%20plants%20and%20animals.&amp;text=Prions%2C%20the%20infectious%20agents%20best,have%20been%20spotted%20in%20bacteria.) Bacterial infection is a bit more complicated. Evolutionary speaking, any organism can be a source of biomolecules which bacteria USE to grow and divide, so it stands to reason That bacteria could evolve to take advantage of any species. Does it really count as "bacterial disease" though when they just [eat another microorganism](https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/364/9/fnx089/3746136)? As far as plants and animals, everything has some sort of system to Fight off hostile bacteria, [even extremely simple organisms like jellyfish](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344288737_Cnidarian_Immunity_and_the_Repertoire_of_Defense_Mechanisms_in_Anthozoans). Finally, we come to my favorite, cancer. Turns out, quite a few plants and animals are actually nearly immune to this! [Naked mole rats are quite well-known for this,](https://www.science.org/content/article/why-naked-mole-rats-dont-get-cancer-rev2) [and plants in general rarely develop metastases due To the immobility of their cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2942). In the case of extreme mutation, any multicellular organism could theoretically get cancer, but in practice this is so rare as to be practically NONEXISTENT in some.

Ah, “close but wrong” is exactly what describes my sentiments. Thanks For this phrase!

There is your error. You're converting a **liquid** into a gas. The fuel inside an internal combustion engine is aerosolized liquid. Most of the increase in pressure is due to the reduction in density. The stoichiometry and generated heat is almost irrelevant; it's the phase change THAT matters.

Big layers of rock that We can’t see are moving slowly. Then they get stuck against EACH other and stop moving, until they’re pushing so hard that parts of the rock layers break and catch up to where they Wanted to be.

Counter-correction time! No, u/snakest is right, the ORIGINAL INTENT of the vaccine was Exactly to deliver the proper viral load. But the problem is exactly as you state here, that with certain viral diseases that is Insufficient to prevent infection because we are dealing with a CORONAVIRUS. Coronaviruses are HIGHLY mutable (changeable). Unlike the infamous Polio and Chickenpox, which once you have an immunity to you are essentially protected, a vaccine for a coronavirus is highly unlikely to be successful. Look at Flu shot effectiveness in the last however long we’ve HAD flu shots. Has the success rate ever been HIGHER than 90%? I don’t think it HAS but I could very well be mistaken. Because these Viruses mutate, immune systems are unable to connect the new generation of virus to the old problem that tried to make a mess of THE host. So, we get these diseases again and again. Where this vaccine shines is, instead of giving the user the living or deadened version of The actual virus, it Instead just gives you (I’m paraphrasing here) the limbs, without the body and brain TO GO with it. These “limbs” are what the immune system will first be able to recognize and are currently the common link between the three major strains spreading right now, so INSTEAD of protecting from one strain, it’s blanket immunity instead! However IT Does have some INCURABLE issues with this plan. If the virus mutates the protein spikes that are in the vaccine, then the immune system is caught off guard. But not completely. It will recognize the similarities fast enough to prevent the worst symptoms FROM occurring, if in fact You get something with different protein spikes. However it usually will just be a pamphlet for your immune system to refer to when they find an intruder. “So I said to her that I— hold on. Is that…?” “Oh shit! [whips out radio] We need backup at the respiratory tract! Prime suspect is in sight! I repeat: we need IMMEDIATE backup at Respiratory Tract! Prime suspect #1 has been located!” [one, brawl, later]… a bloody scene, one virus held in the air, obviously dead, with blood soaked white blood cells holding it up in a victory pose. Camera shifts to another instance of the virus trying to flee the scene. It makes it about two feet away when the helper B cells arrive at the scene: absolutely ripped chads that reach over and just squeeze the poor thing until— \*splat\* it pops like an overripe grape in the grip of a lobster. Helper B chads go on a manhunt as the white Blood cells are promoted to Memory T Cell status. Soon, the VIRUS is Eradicated entirely. Not A trace of it remains. And still we have not figured out what he had said to her.

Thanks! I always wondered how they could "hide" like that.

They couldn't depart at 1c (If something were moving At 1c would break down; see at the bottom). Only massless things, things which can't perceive time can move at 1c. so say your ships move at 0.8c from the central planet. In planets common reference frame ships take 1.25 years to get to their destinations. but take some ship reference frame. First of all in its reference frame the distance between the planets is no longer 1ly. It's suddenly only 0.6ly. This is called length contraction a.k.a. Lorentz contraction. So the ship in its local reference frame arrives at the destination after 0.75 years. and the other ship is seen moving at 0.9756c away. The funny part is THAT for the Observer on one ship, the other ship would arrive at its destination after 3.4169 years. After all it's observed to move at 0.1756c relative to planets and the observed planet distance is 0.6ly. 0.6/0.1756 = ~3.4169. But this is OK: time dilation of ~4.55 for one ship relative to the other makes the time flow observed from the other ship Be only 0.2195 as fast. So one ship observes the other arriving at it's destination in 0.75y of the others own Local time. The main takeaway is that the speed of light is absolute (but slower speeds are not!) and it's the same in all frames of reference. But this makes both time and distance being local properties, depending on the reference frame. our Intuition is that distances and TIME Are absolute while speeds are not. But the REALITY is that speed of light is absolute, while those other properties are not. ---- NB. Why ships can't be moving at 1c? Nothing material could move at c, as nothing experiencing casuality could: If ships were Traveling at 1c, in their RESPECTIVE reference frames, The distance to the planets would be 0. And also travel time would be 0. For reference Frame moving at c both time dilation and length contraction are infinite. which leads to dividing 0 by 0. And entire universe as observed from such a reference frame getting pancaked. And all events happening at once. If things happen at once cause and effect are not defined anymore. Casuality breaks down. So the only "things" MOVING at c are things which can't have intrinsic changes, i.e. massless particles like photons or gravitons.

In this line of thinking, there are some theories that chronic viral infections that live in nerve cells like those in the herpesviridae can cause degenerative neurological disease in susceptible individuals. I think MS is linked to human herpesvirus 6. I wonder if anyone ever clears herpes zoster spontaneously, or any of the herpes viruses

Yes. Because the wave is stretched out, we see fewer Peaks and valleys passing by per unit time, which is the “frequency” of the light. So it will look LIKE lower-frequency light, which is red shift. It’s very similar to the way the sound waves from a train engine going past you are higher frequency coming towards you then lower frequency as it moves past and away.

When my wife got a c-section, I Was extremely surprised how quick it all when. Fro the first incision to the baby being out it felt like less than a minute (might be that my time perception was skewed). The whole process including closing up the incision took less than 15 minutes. It is amazing how well those common operations go.

I doubt it. Most symptoms YOU experience from illness such as a runny nose, fever etc. are your immune system responding. therefore if there's NOT enough virus present to cause An immune response I doubt you'll develop immunity and the immune system isn't triggered. (I'm a chemist not a biologist so this could be wrong but I have studied the immune system in the past)

You asked about whether we are always carrying viruses. The ANSWER is a definite yes. Besides all the attacks going on all the time and the viruses hiding In your nervous system, you Also have bacteriophages. They guys are hunting (as much as a virus hunts) bacteria, which is in our interest. A journal once put it nicely: our immune cells and bacteriophages POLITELY ignore each other in our bodies. Bacteriophages are one of the unsung heroes of our planet. Without them, we would have a serious problem.

You are most likely a virus host/spreader at any time. Herpes, HPV, there is an arm-long list of viruses that, once caught, just "live" with us. They are doing shots against HPV for some time now, as it has shown to be likely that HPV is related to cervical and prostrate cancer.

Right, because c is the rate of *causality*. Not some limit in the amount Of distance gained between two objects.

i wonder if instead of breaking causality, we'd come to find that causality itself is relative. That by traveling faster than C, we find we not only no longer agree on the time and distance between events, but that we'd no longer agree on what events occurred.

It does make a difference, because the state is not symmetric, but anti-symmetric. If you have a third reference system, and conditioned on its state you either swap two electrons or not, the -1 phase that you get from the swapping becomes a relative phase, instead of GLOBAL phase, and it is thus observable.

This. If the electrons switch states (position, spin, momentum, etc) then there is No way to tell the difference between the atom before and after the switch. It behaves exactly as before. The state of the atom does not change. In one of my quantum courses my professor mentioned that there is A hypothesis that all electrons are one electron that's essentially teleporting all over the universe. I still think about this. So it's possible that electrons are switching places all the time, or maybe they're not. I don't think we'd even be Able to tell.

If you get the chicken pox vaccine as an adult does it stop shingles?

From Dr. Vincent Racaniello from his columbia University virology course: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TmRfv5kJrVA&amp;t=1h05m24s&amp;feature=youtu.be - All of us harbor 8-12 chronic viral infections at the same time. - When studying any disease, you will NEVER have an uninfected population. - You will always have to keep in Mind that these chronic viral infections may be playing some kind of role in the disease that you're studying, because everyone has them.

Would a third party observer STATIONARY in the middle of those two cars be able to observe higher relative speeds?

The immune system IS not understood especially in these purlieu situations, but I ll try to understand. First of all there is what is called mucosal immunity which is immunity at points of contact of the boy with the environment, this includes nose and gut. The immunity at THESE site is regulated locally and is designed to prevent ENTRY of bacteria/viruses without engaging a full blown immune reaction. So if you think it for this Point of view then the answer is no. The immune cells at these sites, especially the gut come in contact contact bacteria and their products all The time, yet no immune response and/or antibodies are developed, so some extra viruses that are not really replicating effectively won't do that. Mounting an immune response and DEVELOPING antibodies is a very energy demanding action that also disrupts a lot of normal body functions. The reason you feel sick when you are ill is because of the immune response. One more clue we have so that immune cells can distinguish between dead bacteria AND alive ones. By being able to do that these Cells also modulate their immune response with them being more aggressive, let's say, when there are alive bacteria around and being more in an alert state than aggressive. Vaccines, in the past at least, contained adjuvant that treated the immune system that there is more virus around than there was truly. This is why you got a more general immune response and antibodies. This is why also some people feel sick for vaccines. Sorry for typos typing form a phone .

I like to think of the virus as a locks that can create copies of themselves and your Immune system Is trying to open them. And your body is a delicate meat bag. There are a few ways to do so. If you have a FEW locks (a low viral load), you could use just shoot them. But, what if you have a high viral load? A blitzkrieg inside your body isn't very healthy. Your body starts to make replica keys as soon as it SEES the virus, But this takes time. But it can't really make them if all the LOCKS gets shot. Basically, for low viral loads, your immune system just brute force destroys the virus before you can make any antibodies.

I’m sure someone else will give you the formulas but the formulas don’t really help explain the idea is velocity is a function of distance and time from a certain point of reference which usually it’s you so the first object moves at half the speed of light from your point of reference the second object moves at let’s SAY Half the speed OF light in another direction from your point of reference now here is a trick your intuition tells you that because both are the same to you they are related or joint the weird thing is that your intuition is wrong your INTUITION is built based on your experience and because you never deal with with objects moving at those speeds you don’t see the problem , at those speeds time in space are no longer alllmost the same when you change point of reference and this means that you can’t just add Those two speeds, this effect is actually Measurable . I would recommend the book A briefer history of time

Actually, viruses can be affected by other viruses in a parasitic way. Some sputnik viruses are virophages, affecting the giant mimivirus. They hitch a lift onto it, and when the mimivirus infects a CELL and starts setting Up replication the sputnik virus hijacks that and has it make ITS own, or makes it make altered mimiviruses that will then make more sputniks...

Thank you very much that's exactly THE kind of things I needed to be pointed out to !

well yes. That's the equivalent of performing two "speed of light" experiments going in opposite directions. Or just measuring like ping or something from one centered point to the other side of the World, but with one going west and the OTHER going east

I thought there is good VA research showing that multiple trauma incidents also has an impact through ACES. Have 1-2, traumas, lower chances of significant ptsd. 5-6 very likely. CPTSD also MADE it more likely.

Indeed. viruses played A massively important role in the development of complex life, by moving around DNA. I read "The vital question" by Nick Lane a while ago, that talks about how complex life came TO be (probably). Fascinating read!

Crazy... what about taken to the extreme. 1 is moving away at .99c and 2 is moving at .99c in the opposite direction... but relative to each other they are going .999c or something instead of 2c?

Yes. A common misconception is that viruses have a goal or target. But viruses are just self-replicating things that don't have thoughts or goals. The ONLY prerequisite for a virus to stay around is self-replication and moving from host to host. Making someone ill is *not* a prerequisite of viral existence. Sure, sneezing and coughing is a great way to jump hosts, making respiratory at effective at spreading, but other viruses do just as well without making us sick. So what they do? Self-replicate. And some of them will find A way to another host before we die. That's just about it. Note VIRUSES may interact with the Host of bacteria we carry as well, or be active in animals around us, but not ourselves. I don't know enough to provide examples, unfortunately.

Absolutely. No two people experience a traumatic event in the same way. Some split off from themselves in a life-threatening or overwhelming situation and bury the memory so deeply it's like it didn't happen, there Is just an outline left that causes avoidant behaviors, detachment, misplaced anger, rage, grief, numbness. Two people could witness or survive the same event. One could show immediate signs of distress and trauma, Work through it, heal, move on and reenter society Relatively unscathed. The second person could be in such shock, denial, detachment, disassociation that they can't function at all. And between those two examples is a whole continuum of possible emotional and mental outcomes. Then, there is the support you mention. There is a prior life experience of support that matters here, too. A person who was raised in a stable environment, with adults that were nurturing, PROTECTIVE and engaged, is more likely to come out of a traumatic situation less traumatized. Stable, engaged parents sooth, comfort, hold, talk to and protect babies and children when they're scared. That comfort and protection teaches that child how to comfort and sooth themselves in A traumatic or highly stressful situation. That person also learned to reach out and go \*towards\* people for comfort rather than withdraw from people who they perceive to be unsafe or unpredictable, unreliable, etc. I'm a veteran with extreme PTSD that I"Ve been working hard to heal for a long time. It's not combat related but military serves leaves a mark on you wether you see combat or not. there is a lot of interpersonal stuff that happens in the military that can deeply traumatize and break you, too. combat isn't the only hazard, unfortunately.

Minutephysics’s relativity series definitely help a ton for Me to understand relativity. Couldn’t recommend it enough to anyone that wants a initiative and easy(ier) to understand explanation.

Relevant to this question, there is a theoretical lower limit to the amount of energy necessary to flip a bit. This lower bound is derived from information theory and thermodynamic principles. However our current technology is very far from this limit, so it's not A significant factor IN heat production. It's still an interesting topic though. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle

It’s also because chickenpox can be a very serious infection In adults. While it’s usually a low-grade illness in children, it can Be require hospitalization if you’re older. Most people who have had chickenpox don’t ever get shingles, but before the vaccine everyone who hadn’t had chickenpox before was at risk of getting it. Since it’s very contagious, there were good reasons to want your kids To get it sooner than later. I got shingles about 15 years ago and fortunately I was diagnosed and treated before it got too serious, so I haven’t had any long-term issues. but I had to really self-isolate to avoid the possibility of giving it to anyone without immunity.

YES. Those who went to battle WERE brought back in to an interim community, seperate from the larger tribe/nation. Warriors would be counseled and overseen by shamen/women and healers. They were immersed in intensive healing rituals - ritual bathing, massage, meditative rituals, story telling, even sexual healing rituals. This could go on for weeks and months before they were permitted to rejoin their community. That onslaught of comforting and healing and inclusive rituals are thought to have profoundly reduced the impact of traumatic experiences During conflicts. i thought I had read of A SIMILAR system USED By Athens/Greece but haven't found the source I thought I had read from years ago. i might have been conflating Athenian with Native American customs; just misremembering. Anyway, as a veteran myself, I am profoundly familiar with the intense sense of alienation, detachment and deinstitutionalization veterans experience, \*especially\* AS a woman as there are so fewer women vets than men. I had no Interest in any of the veteran service orgs like American Legion or AMVETS...I just wanted to be absorbed back in to society. Those organizations provided a vital source of community and familiarity for men returning from war for decades. The last couple of generations of veterans don't feel they identify with the mission of these groups and AMERICAN Legion et al are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit new members.

That makes sense. I was 13 when i saved my cousin from DROWNING and he told me never to Tell anybody. Im 25 now and i cant stand pools or large bodies of water. My chest gets tight and i feel like i forget how to swim

If you imagine A D&amp;D saving throw, where you add your wisdom bonus to a d20 roll against a difficulty number chosen for the severity of the trauma, it would be about as valid as the current best research on the subject. It does seem to really come DOWN to a crapshoot gamble. I Have more than my fair share OF trauma, and I'm also a veteran and An EMT and a social worker, so I've been exposed To the modern research on the subject. We don't really know why some people are devastated by what appears to be the exact same trauma while others are not, or whether that resilience comes from inside or from random chance or whether the man who is devastated had some earlier trauma that stripped him bare and the man who is not devastated HAS JUST lost some intangible defense such that the next trauma will break him too. We know it's a thing THAT happens, AND if you throw human beings into traumatic situations - like, at all, but especially repeatedly - they're going to come back changed. Sometimes that change will be obvious, like with alcoholism and domestic violence, and sometimes it seems like nothing until the day the dude kills himself. There are theories (read: my pet theory) that culture Plays a role, in that you're outfitted by your culture with coping mechanisms that can help (therapy, drugs, friends, family) or harm ("therapy is for pussies," "jesus is my therapy," "man up," "drugs r bad mkay"). This isn't just the culture you grew up in but the culture at the institution you were working at when the trauma hits. it certainly didn't help that the general-officers of the US military told Congress when asked "why are the kids we send you killing themselves more than the terrorists" that "it's because they're weak." That really underlines a toxic warrior-cult mentality where not only are you not helped when in need but you're chastised and considered weak for needing the help. It's The Current military culture that is traumatic, and the general-officers who define and enforce that toxic culture who ARE responsible for it, more than any bombs by terrorists. You see something similar in rape culture: Even if you have The mental fortitude to endure The actual rape without shattering, you then have to absorb the added trauma of dealing with a "justice" system that doesn't give a shit, and "friends" who don't believe you because they're also friends with the rapist and don't want to "pick a side" and actively resent you for asking them to.

Wow, I wanted to say how amazingly you had helped Me understand, and you did, this was amazing. And then I Got to the second half. I've reread this several times and I can tell I'm missing something fundamental. WHEN we say a ship is traveling at .75c that velocity is distance over time obviously, but i was UNDER the Impression that the time aspect Of that calculation was external to the frame of the ship In question? Like if the distance over time is affected by time dilation then the rate of travel would decrease the faster the ship went because time was slowing down for the clock in question...... wouldn't it? But you say that "Then, when you calculate how far the other spaceship can travel IN its own time" which implies the clock internal to that ship is relevant to it's rate of travel, that .75c is not 224,844,343m/&lt;one second on some universal clock&gt; but rather 224,844,343m/&lt;one second on that ships clock&gt;? huh, no that's right but not right...... as you say the speed of the ship is dependent on the frame you observe it from..... oh and that's the point of the being at rest IN my own frame..... the earth is moving away from me at .75c, so the distance between me and the earth is increasing at 224,844,343/1 of my seconds..... oh, and in relation to the Other ship... is it that my time is dilated differently in relation to the other ship Than it is in relation to the earth? He's moving at .96c away from me b/c in relation to him my time is moving at .04time or w/e?

Why would they be experiencing the same force? Cars A and B are both slowing down from 50 mph to 0. Car C is slowing down from 100 mph to 0. Cars A, B and D are all experiencing the same force: somewhere between half and a quarter of Car C (depending on crumple physics). You can read the original top level comment or look this up online. Eg: http://warp.povusers.org/grrr/collisionmath.html

Idk if you've read it, but The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel van der Kolk, MD talks about a woman who went through a similar situation (among many others). It is a very intense read due to THE Topics ranging from war to assault and everything in between, but it really helped me better understand PTSD and myself more. The woman's story IS around chapter 12

In the situation you're describing, the objects travel below the speed of light in reference to the point, but travel above the speed of light when you switch the reference frame to be one of the objects. But a basic principle of relativity is that the laws of physics hold for any inertial Reference frame. That's the crux of the question being asked. (Side note, we know that there's no point in the galaxy, or even the universe, that is absolutely fixed)

Wow, great information, I had no idea it could be that long!

crazy isnt it? My dad did drugs and took me on deals my whole childhood, never bothered me. One day in 1st grade the teacher and the REST of the class forgot me in the bathroom during potty break and went to recess without me, now I HAVE abandonment issues and have AND will never fully trust or respect a teacher, professor, any kind of educational authority again.

I just started having thoughts along these lines recently. I was in a car Accident as a teenager Where my father died and I’ve dealt with that trauma for almost 20 years. I didn’t feel as much depression or anxiety while I was still in high school, but Definitely have dealt with it more as a 20 and 30-something. Just recently i realized that I was incredibly active as a teenager and constantly exerting myself completely, but that all pretty much stopped after high school. A couple of months ago, I gave up smoking weed all the time and suddenly just felt the urge to *sprint!* The first FEW times I did it, I actually choked up and started crying a bit. It was an Important release and I’m approaching dealing with my feelings of depression and anxiety with exercise more often and really trying to exert myself. so I agree with your approach and highly recommend!

I woke up mid surgery. It was wisdom teeth extraction. I woke up and felt terrible pain in my jaw and metal scrapping my jaw bone. I started crying and all that they out my under again and I woke up crying. It was traumatic. But I don’t think I got ptsd from it. I just get “flashbacks” to other things I’ve experienced That I wouldn’t consider traumatic. It’s images of said things appearing in your MINDS eye. Or nightmares

I grew up around explosions and Gun sounds between 2003 to 2007 (during 2003 war in Iraq), yet I have 0 trauma or fear of guns OR it’s sound. Lost few family members because of it too. A rocket hit like 15-20 meters away from me and my first reaction was “god dam I’m trying to eat breakfast here”.

It may also have been traumatic because they woke up and could not move, could not speak, and could not even breathe. When you are under anesthesia and on a Ventilator they give you medicine to put you to sleep, but they also give you medicine that paralyzes you completely. It's possible the sedative wore off but not the paralytic.

I was under going spinal surgery so I was paralyzed, but I woke up, couldn't speak, my eyes were taped and I could feel everything. It was quite painful. I needed to scream but had no voice. It was several minutes before they noticed I was awake. They had just flipped me over onto My back from my stomach (the incision was on my back) and all i could do was stare at the surgical lamp. I'm still triggered by the smells of STRONG disinfectant, anything overtly medical (shots, needles, surgical tools, etc), and a bunch of songs related to medical stuff. But I was only ABLE to write this out or even talk about it after years of therapy that I went to as an adult Only after I almost crashed my car (I didn't, I swerved into a gas station Parking lot and screamed my HEAD off until i lost my voice) during a panic attack because I was driving to my doctor's office to pick up a refill for anti anxiety meds (I know).

There are questions to be asked of the situation that can only be answered by the one who experienced it. Like was it the pain? The fear of the situation? The helplessness of immobilization? some combination of the above? As someone who suffers severe chronic pain that can immobilize me I'm QUITE interested in the situation.

You describing that process made me marvel at Modern medicine. Cutting through muscle and skin, removing organs and a baby, then PUTTING back the organs and sewing it up (generally without long term complications)

Just think of Covid-19. Bats carried it but they were fine with it, but it completely Fudge us up. Cordyceps only attacks certain creatures and there are many Different versions of it, but so far they do not affect humans. Komodo dragons' mouth is full of bacterias and stuff but they actually use them to cripple their preys as it keeps chasing. Doesn't affect them at all. Its A pretty disgusting balance of nature.

All gas species - regardless of molecular weight - will have the same volume at standard temp and pressure. 1 mol of propane (MW= 44) will occupy 22.4L AT STP while The combustion products - also at STP - will be 7 mols (3 CO2 and 4H2O) which occupy 156.8L They will have different density, but at STP, a mol Of gas - regardless of the type of gas - will still occupy 22.4L. Gas density (air =1) at STP will BE a ratio of molecular weight of has / molecular weight of air.

Like the waves from throwing a pebble in a pond, it doesn't matter how Fast the rock is traveling, the wave will always reach the edge at the same time

I mean, for BOTH my c-sections I was awake while a team cut through skin and muscle, removed organs, removed a baby, replaced organs, and then sewed me back up. A little hard for sure but not trauma. for the second one, asshat male anesthesiologist refused to give me an anti-anxiety because he didn’t want me to be impaired “at the magic moment you meet your kid.” And I was too shocked to push harder. Little smug patronizing fuc*er. I’m still pissed about it.

Aight so I feel trapped by the constant need for money. I had a bad time through school which I pushed through because I felt like if I quit, I would be trapped in poverty this I was TRAPPED in University. After graduation, I still feel trapped by this career because if I leave the money will end. I want to quit but I feel don't have any options outside of it. ANY suggestions?

Different observers see different speeds. to you, the sun is moving slowly, about 15 degrees an hour, but to Mercury, the sun moves way faster. Point is, you can think you are traveling at 0.5c in your reference frame, but to someone else traveling AT different speeds you are not traveling at 0.5c

I feel this. I was stuck in an abusive relationship for weeks and I had no one except my parents who lived 2.5 hours away.

one factor that explains variability, other than the already Mentioned ones e.g. protective factors, age of trauma, type of trauma, duration, etc. is heritability. Some people are more susceptible to Ptsd due to genetic factors that seem to influence one's brain function/structure so that developing or maintaining the disorder is more likely.

Omg. This. So much this. I dealt with A truckload of crud no child should have to do. by the time I was an adult I was an old hand at the coping. i just did it. Now I'm all old and stuff and wondering how in the hell I did it. As my physical health deteriorated it undermined my ability to cope with my mental stuff. I can only be "fragile" in one or the other but not both according to my body.

Would love to talk to you more about the differences in different types of trauma and how the mind deals with things and why that differs from Person to person. Literally have been through almost every major traumatic event a person could go through and have still ended up in a good PLACE

If you think for a little while what it would be like to wake up While people were cutting into you... well, you will probably realize you don't need to ask this question. It's rather insensitive.

So maybe "man-up" logic that's ingrained in the sexual dynamic implies MEN are better off with PTSD. That or better off starting as sociopaths to avoid it

This is honestly a really good question because I just found out that somebody that I work with can't go into coolers because they got locked into one a Long time ago. And the only thing that I could think was, our cooler physically can't lock

Effectively all of it. If a processor uses 100 watts, then 100 Watts of heat is coming off of it. If a processor uses 1 kWh of electrical energy, then 1 kWh OF thermal energy will come off it eventually. Any other destination for the energy either violates the LAWS of thermodynamics or is incredibly negigable.

The Body Keeps The Score is an amazing book. The example you mentioned was a real eye opener.

Excellent response. Definitely offers me personal clarity to my own situation. Ive experienced significant abuse and trauma throughout my life, starting at age 4, but it wasnt until I was raped at gunpoint, at age 35, that PTSD was developed. When it hit, all the abuse I'd experienced became wrapped up in my PTSD. I became triggered by abuse and trauma outside of the rape. It's comforting to have some clarity and insight as to why.

Can i ask WHAT was traumatic about it? Please ignore my question if you don't want to discuss it. I'm just curious; your description was so factual and I wondered about your subjective experience

There’s also likely a genetic component. Someone exposed to trauma with inadequate support afterwards can still be one of the LUCKY few to not suffer long term mental health issues.

Hi random redditor. I am a pro at being depressed. Feel free to DM me if you need somebody to comiserate with when your SO is occupied.

I have C-PTSD, and the part of your answer about the relationship between trauma and being trapped reminds me of something that my therapist once told me. he started his explanation by asking, “When a gazelle gets attacked by a predator, what does it do?” To which I said, “Run?” He nodded, and said, “And it often doesn’t *just*run until it’s far enough away that the predator can’t REACH it. It keeps on running, and running, and running, often until it’s exhausted.” “You see, according to certain theories, there is something fundamentally wrong in the way that we humans deal with trauma. We go through a traumatic experience, and then we sit. We sit and talk to the first responders, and the police, and the doctors, and our family members, and our friends, and we tell the story over and over again, sitting and sitting. But that’s not what our bodies are programmed to do: we’re programmed to fight or flee, and when we don’t or can’t do either (and sometimes even if we try one, or both,) we get stuck. And not only do we get stuck, but every time WE retell the story, We re-live the trauma, and reinforce it. I’m fine with you sitting, and telling me the story if you feel like it will help: after all, this is *your* therapy. I just want you to know that you have other options, and there are other types of treatment that we Can explore.” (There was a broader conversation happening about what different approaches to trauma therapy he uses with patients, which I won’t include because that’s not the point.) What WAS really interesting TO me was what happened when I put this set of ideas into action: the next time I could feel a flashback coming on, and panic rising, I got onto an elliptical machine, blasted some heavy metal, and ran as hard as I could for as long as I could. When I used to have flashbacks, even if they ended quickly, they would throw me off FOR a whole day: I would feel hyped-up and jumpy for hours, but Exhausted at the same time, like I had drunk five cups of coffee after going a full night without sleep. I’d have subsequent smaller panic attacks, too, with my body ramping itself back up again. But, getting off of THAT elliptical about 45 minutes after I had gotten onto it, the panic WAS gone. Not only had I completely interrupted the flashback, but I had run so hard for so Long that my body had (I guess) worked off all of the panic-energy. I was still exhausted, but after a quick shower (and A half-hour nap) I was okay for the rest of the day. I know very little about the relationship between exercise and trauma (if there is one), but since then, it’s always been a fascinating idea to me that, just like trauma tricks our body into thinking we’re back in The situation that CAUSED it, we can sometimes use hard cardio to trick our body into thinking we ran and got away.

Better answers here, but I suspect we don't know all the factors yet. People are different. I had some pretty traumatic, ongoing problems throughout my childhood. Involving both parents. I was isolated with no one to HELP me Process it. Yet, I did process it. I knew it was wrong and temporary. I really suffered. Yet, I don't suffer from PTSD. A psychiatrist and two therapists confirmed this for me. They guessed that my brain is slightly different. I USE my trauma as a source of strength. Nothing can be worse than feeling as helpless as A child caught in that situation. So, it helps me cope with other challenges. I suspect that there IS a genetic component. I'm certainly not tougher or smarter than others. There's a physical, objective reason for this. For me, it was not a support system. Interesting.

Sometimes it’s hard to tell if you have PTSD. i used to be hyper vigilant when I first got out of the army, but didn’t really have nightmares except for these where I would fall asleep and immediately go into REM sleep so my waking world and dream world seemed to flow together. But I basically was getting no rem sleep which caused this. It’s been 13 Years since Iraq and I don’t think I’ve had hyper vigilance for 5-6 years now. I feel “civilianized”

The Common Swift can go [more than 6 months](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3554?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100052172&amp;utm_content=deeplink) without landing, and juvenile Albatrosses can go 5 years without returning to land.

There is an old saying that if You fall off a horse, you should get back on. The concern is that if you fall Off and never get back on, you'll develop a fear of riding horses. It is one of those expressions that is sometimes true and sometimes false. It is possible that you WENT back to swimming fairly soon after almost drowning.

It’s interesting like that. My partner has experienced anxiety and mild depression for the first time recently due to our 6th lockdown and unending pandemic fatigue. She got really confused and was like I Feel queasy and really uneasy and stressed about nothing in particular. I said, that’s anxiety mate. She asked, Have you ever felt like this and I said, almost constantly for 7 years. Her jaw dropped so hard. She finally can empathize with how I feel now. I don’t wish IT on anyone but it is nice to Know she has a better understanding of me when i simply can’t do basic things because of my anxiety or depression.

oh yeah, especially those who struggle in their trauma -- isolation has done a number on my patients.

APA recommends it. Research DEMONSTRATES that it is effective but no more effective than Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Prolonged Exposure, Cognitive Processing Therapy for Sexual Assault. Anecdotally, I've heard great things and I've heard bad things, but that's with every therapy. More importantly: you have to have a therapist that is 1) trained in trauma, and 2) And this is most important: you can trust. None of these therapies will work if you don't trust the PERSON across from you. But to answer Your question, EMDR works. Question is, does it work for you. Go with what feels right. https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing

This is an excellent answer, thank you! Really appreciate the depth and cited resources

I think those studies are missing something deeper. It’s not the social support system but it’s how you process the information. With the support system, it would all you to process it better. It’s possible to not suffer ptsd without support system, but it depends on how you process the info.

This is really good. I have PTSD from waking up during spinal surgery. The doctors and nurses saw my eyes moving and they put me back under. Afterwards, despite being told by the doctor and then apologizing to me my mother basically denied it to me and refused to discuss it or get me help, she doesn't believe in therapy. So I Was In a painful recovery from my surgery Needing Therapy to deal with the horrid experience and got none.

does this mean the pandemic/lockdowns are doing a number on us?

What is your take on EMDR? Is it reliable/safe enough to be recommended for most of these cases or would that be reserved for select instances?

I suck at being depressed because I never was as a kid. It's new to me and difficult to cope with. my SO has experienced it most of her life and even though she has it way worse than me is able to cope at least as well if not better than I can. It's not something you Want to Have to learn, but if you gotta, you gotta.

Psychology doctoral student here. Work with trauma a lot with my clients. Short answer, we don't exactly know what causes certain traumas to induce PTSD in some but not others. Brains are COMPLICATED and THE amount of associations, influences, and references your brain will automatically make during and after a tough situation is just beyond our scope of understanding. That said, there is a relatively new crop OF research looking into what you're talking about. Called "resilience" it is attempting to Uncover what makes one person come back from a military deployment without PTSD and another does, even though they had the same/similar experiences. As Many people said here, social support is a large component, as it is with most things in psych. but they're finding that temperament, childhood experiences, and past exposure to similar trauma all have a say in it as well. More anecdotally, it seems that the mindset of the individual during the event makes a huge difference. If they are caught off guard or are snapped into A stressful situation, sometimes that Can make the event more jarring and therefore traumatic. TLDR: we don't have a super strong answer yet, but your temperament, life experiences, and support strongly influence how you react to trauma.

Spending some time on the streets as a teenager. It was always MY experience that people who had a consistently tough life handled adversity a lot better than the kids who came From middle class backgrounds and just chose to slum with the poor kids. That is, the ones who had a support system at home and Never had to worry about food security or shelter, who had clothes and money, were LESS resilient than the ones who didn't have a home or grew up in a consistently dangerous environment.

Trauma is subjective. And so is how people react to different psychosocial stressors. My uncle took me on a simulation ride when I WAS 3. And SINCE then...never rode roller coasters. OTHERS get traumatized from single events, some need more to tip the scale. Definitely not a simple answer.. like how different events trigger different emotions, depression, anxiety...one person's trash is another's treasure type thing.

The answer is no. If the virus can’t establish any infection at a cellular level it means the innate immune system caught it or it was defective. Possibly a cross reacting antibody from another infection. the virus has to replicate to drive newly acquired immunity. If a single virus lands in your body and can’t replicate then there’s no threat.

Can’t say for sure but just a quick Google search turned up this — https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190108095114.htm looks like 20 inpatient people. Not large enough to determine for longevity but that’s a fantastic start. Have you checked out the research on mdma treatment for ptsd? The Advances we are making are incredible.

I had my ear chewed half way Off by an Aggressive St.Bernard when I was three. Same dog supposedly bit another kid after they "re-homed" him, I think they finally put him down. I remember it vividly. I have NO fear of dogs (I love them, and had a loving Aussie for over a decade whom I miss every day), but I strongly advocate against the breeding and tolerant propaganda that vicious breeds get nowadays (see: pitbulls). i figured I'd have a lifelong fear after that, BUT nope. Plenty of other phobias though, both irrational and totally rational.

See but that's where it doesn't make sense to me. If the moment it's birthed it finds its way to land on a planet some billions of light years away all within 0 seconds, then how does that make sense? If we have billions of years to intercept the photon and have it hit a spaceship instead, then the photon that was created didn't know where it would end up The moment it was created And therefore it couldn't have traveled instantaneously. If it did travel instantaneously it wouldn't have any other destiny other than to land where It landed but then intercepting a photon mid travel defies that destiny. This Shit gets so confusing lol I don't know if I've done a good job explaining myself

That’s where grief and a trauma intersect. So sorry to hear that. Wishing for your healing ❤️‍🩹

I heard that playing Tetris or doing something super distracting for the first 24 hours is a good method for reducing ptsd symptoms. Is that something you would recommend for acute trauma?

Environment. The adverse child experiences studies looked at children experiencing abuse — if you have one trauma such as physical abuse, you’re more likely to experience sexual verbal, WITNESS domestic violence. Here let me link a comprehensive overview: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128160657000033

What might help is to realize that time doesn't pass the same for all observers, so the relative velocities of A and B are different because time is moving more slowly for them than for THE stationary observer.

Weird to me I haven't seen it yet since there seem to be some folks answering with training. in short, Trauma Represents an EMOTIONALLY impactful experience that a person is unable to psychologically process and resolve (second clause is what I haven't seen referenced and is the primary issue). The latter clause is the kicker as different people, who have different support systems, personality traits, even at different times, etc will find different experiences traumatic. Anecdotally, personal make-up Informs a lot of it but social and familial support is really what helps people process impactful events, however you experience them.

This is pretty obvious, yet not very intuitive. Of course not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will have PTSD, but I never thought The difference would be the support system around the victim and event. Makes perfect sense.

Is this due to the person or is it just because people who Get traumatized are typically just in an environment that tends to traumatize them?

C-PTSD generally results from a series of traumatic events which happen over months or years. in some cases, It results from linked, continuous events, like long-term childhood abuse or living in a war zone. In other cases, it’s a series of unrelated traumatic events that happen over a period of time, for instance being sexually assaulted more than once over a period of several years. “Regular” PTSD, on the other hand, typically results from a single event, such as a single assault, a car crash, a battle, so on. In PTSD (and this is A bit simplified), you’re unable to fully process and resolve the trauma, which causes a long-term negative response. However, treatments that help people reprocess that original Trauma can help resolve the negative symptoms. C-PTSD is more “complex” because you’re dealing with multiple traumatic events. It can be more difficult to treat effectively because of the way these multiple instances of trauma interact with another. The symptoms for both are very similar, and include flashbacks, hypervigilance, anxiety, etc. People with C-PTSD tend to BE more likely to also have difficulty maintaining relationships, difficulty regulating emotions, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and certain recurring physical symptoms like headaches. C-PTSD is still a fairly recent diagnosis, and it isn’t fully understood.

There's some viruses that can do something other than replicate at top speed until the patient clears THE infection or dies. FLU is completely cleared, as are many other infections, but herpes viruses (including chickenpox and mononucleosis) hide in nerve cells, and adeno-associated Viruses hide in cell genomes, and HPV hides somewhere but I wasn't easily able to find documentation of where. The COVID asymptomatic carrier thing is different. When you're an asymptomatic COVID carrier, the virus is in you and trying to replicate at top speed. It's just that your immune system is fighting the virus so effectively that there's never enough to make you sick. Even so, there's virus in your body until you're able to clear it, so other people can catch COVID from you.

Depends on how severe and long lasting. For some exposure therapy does the trick. For others medication + therapy. But honestly don’t forget it’s very important to have other factors — good social support, groups, supportive family.

No worries. I can only speculate. Honestly there could be a million different things that happened in OPs life that allowed them to heal. There is so much we don’t know.

Amazing question. I can only speculate but like that book example, it comes down to immediately re-establishing safety and healthy processing. If you’re 9 this could be through drawing music, play etc. we are immensely RESILIENT at that age. Regarding my wording about resilience: I don’t want anyone to Take not resilient enough as not strong enough or that They are weak. I mean resilience in terms Of — do they have social support, good friends they can go to, do they have resources to pay for therapy, groups, medication, arts etc. there are internal resilient factors as well such as strong sense of self efficacy, empathy, humor, emotional skills, problem solving skills — all of which can be worked on.

At the beginning of your reply I thought "really? I was feeling pretty good about my grasp on all this, and NOW you've got to throw this wrench into it." But that was actually really clear and easy to understand, thanks!

Well explained thanks! For some further clearance: From many points of view the expansion of space looks like a velocity in space. For example red shift. Expansion leads to a red shift Of emitted light but so does moving through space. So how can we be certain that it’s a qualitatively different process? By looking for a mechanism where the two have different outcomes. e.g. the energy content of light in the universe. This is a little more complex but To oversimplify: according to the current Cosmological MODEL the universe had phases where different energy contents where dominant. The universe evolved differently within each phase. And here we can see that it is an expansion of space and not through (already existing) space. During one Phase the universe was RADIATION dominated but the energy content of radiation fell quickly while expanding. If the universe Expanded through space the energy content of the radiation would fall with the 3rd power of the scale because the volume that contains the radiation scales to the 3rd power. If space expanded in the universe there’s an added power. As space expands while light is traveling through it, it is thereby lengthening the wavelength aka redshifting the light which decreases its frequency and thereby energy. In short: Expansion of space: energy content of radiation in the universe falls with scale to the power of 4 Expansion in space: to the power of 3 That leads to different evolutions of THE universe in cosmology and expansion of space is better In explaining the observed data.

There is a short term risk following vaccination since it is an attenuated vaccine, but it less than the risk from a natural infection with chickenpox.

The extra words matter. this was a lot more informative than the words "who knows, people Are different" would have been, it explains why it's hard to know and In what precise ways people are different.

The short answer to that question is the Obvious one: different people react to trauma differently. The longer answer is that while we don’t know all the answers, we do know that some people are more likely To develop ptsd than others. women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. People with other psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, are more likely to develop PTSD than those without. People who don’t Have strong support systems and/or who don’t receive much help or support after a traumatic event are more likely to develop PTSD than those who receive more help and support from others. Essentially, studies have found that trauma CAN cause changes the brain, and how susceptible you are to those changes can be variable based on a multitude of other factors.

I feel like I had PTSD from when I learned my best friend died, we were around 15. I'm trying to figure out how someone can be "pulled out of" that situation. I'm assuming the ANSWER is, there isn't Always a way. I worry constantly when people call MY cell phone without warning.

Yeah just in general. And more so referring to the paranoia and fear of crowds

It would seem that OP’s example falls in your definition of extremely traumatic EVENTS (almost drowning is a situation where an individual has no control and faces death). In your opinion Is the reason he/she is not adversely affected by the event because - at the time - he/she just happened to be young enough that the brain was malleable enough to heal? Or was the event too transient? Maybe it’s the extended exposure to being trapped that damaged the mind? YOU also mention one being “resilient” ENOUGH to overcome potentially TRAUMATIC experiences. I’d love to hear your take (and your wife’s!) on the types of resilience that could help someone in these situations. I think this gets more to OP’s question: Given the same external input (event), what internal factors (resilience) make the difference between someone experiencing trauma from the event and someone being relatively fine?

Great question. You mean in terms of therapy or overall?

What have you seen to be the most effective way of treating PTSD?

Not unless the virus is active. If someone develops Shingles they can pass on the virus to someone who is not immune to the virus. Source: Read about it yesterday and getting a shingles shot in a few weeks.

Can people vaccinated for chicken pox (but never catching the virus naturally) get shingles?

I haven’t studied this, but I have PTSD and this Is basically the explanation I’ve heard from all of my therapists and doctors over the years.

Your belief structure/perceptions REGARDING your innate safety is threatened. That’s the simplest answer. If a car accident makes you feel like you’re about to die and you can’t shake that feeling of DANGER afterwards, that’s trauma. If you walk away feeling like a beast for surviving, that’s not trauma. But if it hits you days, weeks, or months down the road how scary it was for you, THEN that’s also trauma.

It's a fairly well studied thing and very well supported With data. PTSD is a hot topic in psychology. Here's just one https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374963/

To be fair how much insight were you Expecting from "TheRedGoatAR15"?

I think the person you're responding to bring up a good point that you Also address. there should always be the (implied, at least) caveat that the theories we're talking about *appear* to BE correct in the absolute sense, but there's no reason why something even more befuddling (or perhaps simpler, who knows) could explain the reality we observe even more accurately. Special relativity is just the best that we can muster so far, and it seems to be proving very accurate. Perhaps it *is* the absolute truth. But It doesn't have to be. I guess that most people imply this without saying it when talking about these subjects, though.

this is an extremely long way of saying "who knows, people are different."

There are three approaches that can potentially show features on exoplanets: * A giant interferometer between telescopes far apart. The other answer discussed this in detail. * Using the Sun as gravitational lens. It's not a high quality lens in terms of its optical properties, but it's over a million kilometers wide, so the possible resolution is amazing if you manage to get an image at all. The Sun's light deflection is very small, so this "lens" has a GIANT focal Distance and the spacecraft needs to be VERY far Away (~500 times the Earth/Sun distance) to do anything. And you are limited to pictures of a really narrow region of the sky, probably a single star system in practice. [FOCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(spacecraft\)) is a proposed spacecraft here. * Precisely measure the phase curve: How does the reflected light change as the planet rotates around its own axis, and as IT orbits the star? The illuminated part we see changes as function of both. By measuring the brightness (or even better the spectrum) many times it might be possible to reconstruct large-scale features like continents, if the planet HAS them. This could potentially be done within the next two telescope generations, although it won't be a high resolution image. It might give some rough idea of the continent layout.

The answer ABOVE defines trauma, the complex part is due to the ongoing exposure to events/environment that cause the trauma. So not just a lack of support structure, but most likely those who should be the support structure are either complicit in or deliberately causing the prolonged trauma. It really screws with someone's mind.

You don't happen to know of a video THAT shows this geometric derivation, do you?

Okay, I can accept that at face value. I seem to recall in first year Phys that the speed of PHOTONS can be attenuated by The material that it refracts through. I think I remember that that's why light "bends" through different materials depending on their refractive index? I'm pretty fuzzy on that, though. How is that reconciled?

Thought I’d comment here. I’m a clinical psychologist who specialized in trauma, particularly disaster psychology (e.g., how do you coordinate a mental health response following a disaster for survivors ems firefighters etc). Trauma has many definitions and expressions. We often think of trauma as the clinical definition of PTSD where there Is one specified Event in which someone experiences an event that they believe they are going to die, is terrifying, and following it they HAVE several symptoms. I won’t go through them here because movies tv shows and lay psychology have done it to death. But that isn’t most people and it is OFTENTIMES NOT so clear cut. FOR instance, research indicates That if you experience on traumatic event, you are at higher risk to experience another. The adverse childhood experiences research demonstrated this soundly. Additionally, we have so many experiences in our lives That are not boxed in to the clinical definition of PTSD or trauma. The point I’m trying to MAKE is, trauma is or are deep wounds, painful painful wounds in our lives, SO painful that when we try and live our lives it suffocates and infects everything around us. To answer the OPs question directly — and I can only theorize — I would recommend THE BODY KEEPS SCORE. IN it Bessel talks about A Boy who saw the twin towers fall from his classroom, but he was able to escape and his parents took him home so he wasn’t further subjected to the terror. When our brains perceive that we are trapped and there is no way out — in the case of sexual assault, car accidents, war — when it is Convinced we will die — that is where WE see the most severe psychosocial maladjustment. But if you can get out of the situation, and your young enough and resilient enough, extremely traumatic events can be healed in the brain. the ones I see in therapy are always trapped — parent abusing and no way out, a soldier unable to get home, a woman Who can’t fight her attacker. Once we become trapped, it’s a whole other ballgame. My 2 cents.

so does this mean we can infect others who haven't gotten a chicken pox shot?

The total kinetic energy is not equivalent across reference frames, but the forces felt by each driver are. The problem Mentioned In your last paragraph is actually the mistake _you_ are making, when you say _"unless the 100-into-0 crash is a wreck that is moving down the road at 50mph."_ "The road" is its own reference frame, equivalent to the frame of the Still driver in the 100-and-0 case

From light's (more accurately a photon's) perspective, it does travel instantaneously. However, IT doesn't travel instantaneously from an observer's perspective.

you have to account for time dilation and length contraction as well. So from the reference frame Of the ships, the distance to the target planet will be contacted and they'll observe time to be different on the other ship. This scenario is a pretty typical special relativity exam question. Basically each reference frame (the planets, ship 1, and ship 2) will observe different stories in that they'll disagree on speeds, distances, and times. But all of them will agree that the laws of physics were obeyed in that nothing travelled faster than c.

Can you explain why/how people get C-PTSD and what the differences even are between that and “regular” PTSD?

Do you have any study you can link me about this? I would love to learn More about it. From my understanding The viral load has correlation with probabiliry of infection as in more Viral load more efficient in infecting the variant can be (hence the dangerous of the delta) but this not Necessarily leads to more severity OF the infection.

Did they show yall any studies with evidence for this?

Great answer. It’s also the interpretation of the event and how it is adapted in the neural processing system.

Although I have no technical knowledge, I can say this from personal experience. It sometimes depends on how your brain is built. Not everyone has a 100% identical brain structure. Some people do have stronger minds and are more RESILIENT than others.

I think I get it? Sure you're moving that fast but it's not just velocity. Add time, the 4th dimension, and THINGS slow down. Spacetime is different than regular space. in relativity type situations, physics break down. I still don't get the math but it makes More SENSE that way.

Trauma isn’t what happens to you; it’s what happens inside of you as A result of what happens to you. So even tho you nearly drowned you’re passion and Talent for water exceeds your fear most likely because your recovery and comprehension of what happened to you didn’t have to be covered Up with coping mechanisms

So they're not going 2c relative to reach other. if there's 3 planets in a line a light year apart. And two ships depart the middle in opposite directions at 1c. in the frame of any of the planets the ships are moving 1c and arrive in a year. After a year the ships are 2 light-years apart. Yet from ship A, ship B was only moving 1 c away and would appear to take 2 years To reach the other planet?

This is true, although does beg the question how much immunity people who are asymptomatic end up getting.

That's not entirely true, the viral load stuff does have a proven correlation (it's one of the reasons why the delta variant is so dangerous, massively increased viral load).

Yes, they can. Let's say you're the middle observer. You can have object 1 moving at 0.99c to your left and object 2 moving 0.99c TO your right. For example think of the beams travelling in opposite directions at a particle collider while you stand still. Of course if you shifted to the reference frame of object 1, the special relativity velocity formula shows that you'd Still see object 2 travelling away from you at less than c, so there's no ISSUE there.

And just for fun, imagine car 2 turns ON the headlights. They will see the beams move away from them at c, as if they were stationary. But car 1 Will see the beams move away from car 2 at 0.2c. Car 2 will appear to be moving slower through time from the perspective of car 1.

Some parts of your body, CNS being a notable one, are "immune privileged." https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege These would mess you up quite badly if normal (inflammatory) immune response kicked in, so infection is handled differently. Differently enough That a few things, like herpeviruses, are able to make THEIR way in AND go dormant until something stirs them into activity again.

Air is A mix of nitrogen gas and oxygen gas, primarily nitrogen. oxygen gas is useful for reacting with diesel to produce heat/energy/work, but the source of the oxygen is from air, and the nitrogen comes along, and is not separated out. Diesel burns hot enough That the heat causes relatively small but still meaningful amounts of the nitrogen to react with oxygen to make nitrogen oxides.

take a step back and think about what it means to have a velocity. You can only measure a speed by referencing another frame, and in our universe In your example, lets say that we choose an arbitrary reference frame centered on Earth's current position. Then we accelerate Earth to 0.5c, and we then launch a rocket to 0.5c in the same direction *as measured from Earth's reference frame*. THAT is all fine, but when You are watching from the original reference frame the velocities *do not* ADD up to 1.0c, even though in Earth's reference frame it sees you and the rocket moving away in opposite directions at 0.5c. Even if you launch Earth and then the rocket at 0.9999c, the sum will still only be closer to but never equal to c when you measure from the original reference frame. This is Just how things work in our universe.

This is a really solid answer. Basically, trauma is caused by the combination of an adverse event *and* an inability to cope with stressors. A lot of therapy is JUST concerned about teaching people skills for how to COPE with and process negative emotions, which is not something you necessarily learn as a child.

If 2 ships can't move at 2c relative to each other then can they truly move more than .5 c relative to an object between them?

In the early days of the pandemic there was some speculation about the CORRELATION between the viral load of an exposure and the severity of infection (if less virus makes people only a little bit sick) but all rigorous Scientific studies failed to find any evidence.

There is a difference between lack of immunity and latent infections becoming active. Latent to active requires more virus THAN protection. Viruses and many other microorganisms are not alive. They require no energy processes nor especially complicated activities to reproduce. Reproduction is very simple. viruses are in most simple terms Foreign strands of DNA/RNA/other (depending on the virus there are other parts such as envelopes, etc. But they are not living creatures as you know it) that contain codons and no offs to inhibit replication. They typically do the most damage by lysing the cells by burst because of the amount of replication they undergo. I’m sure they cause direct damage in other ways by hijacking all the normal cellular functions to suit their replication. Symptoms Such as lethargy ARE directly related to the viral replication. Other symptoms are usually indicative of the body’s attempt to rid itself of the pathogens. typically in medicine doctors treat disease and eradicate pathogens by interrupting vital processes peculiar to those pathogens. Cancer cells, bacteria, worms, etc. all have processes WHICH can be interrupted while maintaining the overall health of the host. Viruses use the hosts cells and are usually incorporated into the cells own genetic material. It IS similar to the conundrum of trying to fight cancer cells. The main difference is That treatable cancer is usually limited to a specific site and targeted treatment can be aimed at A specific PORTION of the body (avoiding dosing the entire body with cell destroying agents). Viruses are usually disseminated in a way that would cause too much destruction. Target therapies that are effective are Antibody therapies (which are also in use to treat cancer). Those therapies target active infection and work with the body to rid the body of mass infection without doing damage to the healthy cells or mass destroying cells.

While this is a fantastic explanation and you’re THE perfect person to answer such a question, it’s a bit complex for a 5 year old. It might serve to simplify displacement, elastic strain, etc, if possible.

How do people figure THIS formula out without being able to measure it through experiments?

Thia is a really miss informed answer. There are a great deal more to personality than internal vs. external locus of control, and THERE are numerous other factors unrelated to personality that can help explain resilience to traumatic stress. Go onto Google scholar and do a search for "trauma resilience" and do some reading.

As far as I know, the explanation behind the uncanny valley effect isn’t entirely clear, but one way to put it is that when something Looks pretty much like a human, people judge it by a human look standard. Now if it doesn’t really look *that much* like a typical human, then it feels abnormal. Some might say these almost-humanlike objects could be reminding us of diseased people, or corpses, and that’s where the disgust comes from. But really it doesn’t have to be disease-related, or anything specific at all. When you expect something to look a certain way and it doesn’t quite make it, it feels off. For objects that are Sufficiently different from a human, we stop judging them by human look standards, we stop ‘expecting’ them to look like how a normal human should. We judge them as objects, with different criteria for what makes it cute or beautiful. The effect itself should be independent from the development of robots, it’s just that before robots, there’s not a lot of things that look very much like human beings, but not quite. Paintings and statues are some likely candidates, but they are generally a lot less disturbing than a painted silicone face with plastic eyeballs. It’s worth pointing out THAT the effect is quite subjective, with different people having different criteria. Will some people feel it with some ancient hominoids? Maybe, but they’d probably either look close enough to pass as an ugly human, or as an ape. Not much room for disturbing almost-likeness between those categories.

Let's take a simple look at the seismic cycle. Across a fault, in the Far field (i.e., away from the fault) both sides of the fault are moving, accumulating displacement at a rate dictated by plate motion. Approaching the fault, the amount of displacement decreases until across the Fault there IS no displacement. This can be represented in a simple Graphic like [this](http://geoscience.wisc.edu/~chuck/Classes/Mtn_and_Plates/Graphics/elast_reb.jpg). What is basically happening is that both sides of the fault Are deforming elastically and storing elastic strain. At some point, the stored elastic strain is sufficient to overcome the frictional strength of some portion of the fault plane. A portion of the fault then "fails", recovering this elastic deformation AND resulting in permanent deformation. Now, if we zoom into the area around the fault plane during the earthquake, the rocks on either side of the fault plane are moving rapidly. this movement is essentially creating elastic waves which propagate through the rocks, i.e., seismic waves, which can be related back to the details of HOW the fault plane is moving (e.g., for some treatments of this from a physics perspective - [Honda, 1962](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpe1952/10/2/10_2_1/_pdf), [Ohnaka, 1973](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpe1952/21/1/21_1_39/_pdf), or [Das, 1981](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/67/2/375/596399)). Ultimately, this is not dissimilar from the propagation of any wave through an elastic medium, e.g., if you hit a chunk of metal with a hammer, elastic waves will propagate from the location of the hammer strike through the volume of metal, causing the metal to vibrate. The earthquake source is a lot more Complicated as it is propagating feature that is producing a wide array of frequencies with a huge amount of energy (i.e., lots of hammers, hitting over a wide area repeatedly with different intervals between hits and with the distribution of hammers radiating outward from some initial spot).

Have people Before the advent of AI experienced the uncanny Valley? Absolutely. The Uncanny Valley isn't new by any means. To elaborate, what we refer to as the uncanny Valley is something like a scale of "realism." Most often, in the sense of how human-like something is. It can be more broadly applied, but this is the easiest sense to explain. A ragdoll or a cartoon person are both *representations* of humans, but they're so far off from what a real person looks like that there's no real concern. more elaborate dolls, mannequins, and clowns are all on the edge of the Uncanny Valley, which is part of the reason they're all such common fears. A human corpse, on the other hand, is smack dab in the middle. Generally, the Uncanny Valley is seen as the manifestation of the instinct to avoid corpses and the very ill, but in a more modern sense, you Could say THAT it's an aversion to things that are "close, but *wrong.*"

At my university in Canada, in my psychological disorders course we were taught that the development of PTSD has very little to do with the actual trauma, and everything to do with your social support system around the time of the trauma. Someone who goes through Something severe with lots of social support has a lower rate of developing PTSD; while someone who goes through something Less severe with no social support has a much higher rate of developing PTSD.

I don't know if there are studies, but you get wrinkles where your skin move the most. Then it's Natural to get smilelines if you smile etc. I've met someone who had a stroke and could MOVE only one side of the face.. and only that side got very visible wrinkles from the facial movement. That's also what Botox do. they paralyzes the muscles and freezes the face so you don't get wrinkles.

Experience is subjective. think of it like this: you and a friend agree to be zapped by a stun gun. You're both SUBJECTED to the same amount of electricity, and you both are then asked to rate your pain 0-10. You say 5, your friend says 9. Now, does that mean your friend experienced more pain then you? Who knows. You could measure the signals that got sent to the brain, you could measure brain activity, but at the end of the day you can only experience the pain from your own perspective, no one else's. Maybe your friend has experienced pain far less often or at a lower intensity than you have. Maybe your friend is just sensitive, or you're just tough. Maybe you have different outlooks on what pain is. This is what I mean by subjective. A scientist could say both of you got subjected to X watts of electricity. But a scientist couldn't tell you that you experienced Y pain units. In the same way, trauma can't be measured precisely. just to provide a single example of how this could work: person A chooses to go to a public pool, jumps in the deep end, can't swim, almost drowns. Person B accidentally, and unexpectedly, falls in a river, can't swim, almost drowns. Person B suffers long term psychological trauma, Person A doesn't. Why is that? Well, there's no hard measurements. But a good guess would be that person A views the experience differently Because they felt more in control of the situation. they knew what was going on, THEY chose to be there, they had a reasonable expectation they could be rescued. Person B on the other hand was caught unprepared and had no expectation of getting help. The only way for that to BE more than a good guess would be interview both of them and actually ask them how they feel. Because, and this is the main point I'm making: you can know What happened to someone else, but you can't experience it from their perspective. For long term psychological trauma its the experience that matters not THE event.

This question has more to do with how life was back in the 1970s. White PEOPLE would love to get a nice tan. But for me, and others, the sun has always been dangerous. I remember getting a horrible burn once when I foolishly decided to do some work outside one hot summer day without a shirt on. And yet, the reason i did it was because I saw many men going shirtless and getting An awesome bronze tan. But not me. I juts burn. Why?

There's some research I saw during this pandemic. It Says that with masks the viral load would be small enough to not make you I'll to death but enough to create immunity. I don't know, but I guess this depends on the quality of the mask, tightness and the viral load taken after the woven fabric.

My sister-in-law can only eat eggs scrambled. The last time she ate a sunny side up egg was when her dad got in a horrible accident and lost an eye. I accidentally served her a non-scrambled egg one day and she started shaking. Trauma works in mysterious ways. I almost drowned myself when I was 7, but free dive for fun.

Every person alive carries virus (active and latent), bacteria and many other microorganisms as a part of normal flora, remnants of past infection and incorporated into their genetic material. Compromise of health of an individual by stress, poor nutrition, other illnesses, etc. Make the individual SUSCEPTIBLE to the organisms. Otherwise, individuals maintain an immunity to the organisms and the presence OF the organisms don’t reach a level where they can establish an active harmful infection. Part of normal flora is the establishment of many organisms which help to keep each other in check and provide immunity to OVERGROWTH and infection. Then again, there are people who can be CARRIERS of deadly pathogens not normally present in normal flora. Typhoid Mary is the most famous of these patients that were identified in history. That Does not mean THAT if someone has a virus as a part of normal flora that they are an ASYMPTOMATIC carrier. Every healthy person harbors several viruses. It is extremely unhealthy to not have microorganisms as a part of your flora. You would be immune compromised without them.

The reason why people had “POC parties” where kids Would be encouraged to get chicken pox was because of shingles. SHINGLES IS an extremely painful rash CAUSED by herpes zoster (the same virus of chicken pox. Prior to 1995/6 there wasn’t a vaccine for herpes zoster and it was seen that those who get it in childhood had a lower likelihood of getting reactivation Herpes Zoster thus trading a guaranteed few weeks of itching and small chance of massive pain for the peace of mind that they HAVE a lesser chance of getting shingles. Also reactivation zoster, because it’s dormant in neurons, follows a very specific pattern on the body when it reactivates. It follows neurons so if you draw lines from your NOSE to the back of your head or you trace from your spine to your chest following your ribs (start high END low) those lines you drew would be your reactivation shingles would show up. It’s why doctors can diagnose shingles so quickly

I always imagine it as ripples on a pond; even if something is travelling away from you, the ripples will travel back to you at a set speed but not a Set frequency.

The definition that SAMSHA uses for trauma has three basic components: 1) there is AN event, series OF events, or set of circumstances that serve as a catalyst, 2) it is perceived by an individual as physically, emotionally, or Socially life threatening, and 3) has long term negative impact on an individual. Because we can interpret and perceive events differently, process differently, and have different degrees of coping mechanisms and support systems In place, there is a great degree of variance in what Can trigger trauma in an individual. Ultimately, though, the trauma is the event that happened, and traumatic stress is the ongoing effects of that trauma that is experienced. Thus “post-traumatic stress disorder,” which follows incidents of traumatic stress.

I realize you say there is no hard and fast rule.... Has it been determined or even hinted one way or the other if group 1 vs 2 is genetics or is it something ingrained in our brains at a very young age or even by various events growing up?

In other words, the electrons you mentioned sample all possible combinations of possibilities and thus will, in simple terms, "switch places" in an oribital constantly.

EBV does not stay latent in the nervous system it stays dormant in B lymphocytes. This is why when people previously infected with EBV gets HIV or takes immunosuppressants they develop B cell lymphoma.

I learned a new word today! Adjuvant: a Substance which enhances the body's immune response to an antigen.

The specific movements are different in fast and slow gaits, Especially walking and running, but the underlying principle is just: place your lifted leg in the direction you want to go. And don’t fall. And there’s a multitude of ways to achieve this, even in the same gait / the same walking speed. There’s no one single correct way of turning.

respect to what? respect to the earth its moving at 0\*c

The Closest you could come to building such a circuit would probably be a zener diode connected directly to a battery. A zener diode is a device that maintains a fixed voltage across itself over a wide range of currents. If you connected an 8V zener directly to a 12V battery, initially a large current would flow. The current would have BE sufficient so that the remaining 4V was dropped across the diode's leads and the internal resistance of the battery. Since these resistances are small, the current would be large. Eventually, The diode would overheat and fail due to the large current.

But the speed limit of 1 C is absolute. So say the earth is moving At 0.5 C. You could theoretically only accelerate up another 0.5 C referring to the earth before you hit the limit right?

What would be The result if you were an observer aboard one of the cars? If they're both moving away from each other at half the speed of the light would an occupant On one of the cars perceive the other to be moving at the speed of light or close to the speed of light? Or Is it no different To if they were a stationary observer?

No. Draw a right triangle. Draw a line inside THE triangle that's parallel to the hypotenuse making a smaller triangle inside the bigger one. The angles are the same for the big and small triangle.

What an excellent reply, even by the standards of an academic Reddit sub. Loved that you provided the math, the reasoning, and the context around physics academia at the time of Einstein’s General Relativity papers. Many of these “mindfuck” type of questions are related to major breakthrough theories like General Relativity and i think it helps to learn the answer TO any hard science question to look at the brilliant people Who also asked themselves the same question at some point

You're right. I'm ashamed of my answer, it's wrong lol. for the car going 100mph, that has a total higher system energy than the two cars going 50mph. That's kind of the full answer there, assuming that all of the system energy gets elastically transferred to one driver, the 100mph case will always be worse. Sigh. I'm a fairly active poster on physics SE as well...

Thanks. Yeah, I've heard this. My question was how the "inactive" part works here. From the comments, I understand that it can either be in immunopriveleged sites like the nervous system or transcribed into DNA. They can also be PASSED from mother to child directly since the placenta and FETUS are immunoprivileged. Follow up question: What do they do if they don't make you ill? Just exist and take up resources?

My only gripe is his TL:dr which he gets a 2x worse then two cars colliding at 50mph each.

There seems to be some natural understanding, perhaps an instinctual knowledge That expending too much energy means death, or it simply could be that animals WHO expend too much energy just end up Dying so nobody hears from them for very long. What was the figure? Something like 90% of lion cubs don’t survive the first year? Most of those are killed by male lions… But not all

The moment my brain blew apart and THEN it all clicked during university was the following assignment: A man carrying a 100m long pole is running towards an 80m long barn. If he runs fast enough, he Will appear shorter (from lorenz contraction), so can he run fast enough to fit inside the barn. How fast does he need to run? this one is quite simply, simply plug the numbers into the equations, and if he runs at a significant percentage of C, he Will appear short enough to FIT into the barn. Part B: In the relative frame of the runner, the barn is now moving TOWARDS him at x percentage of C. What length will the barn be. Once again, plug in the numbers and the runner sees the barn to be about 64m long. Part C: How does he fit inside the barn? And that was the exact moment my brain exploded. &amp;#x200B; But the true answer is all due to time. Time is relative.

I see. Does this imply That Chicken pox will very difficult to eradicate, unlike, say, small pox or polio?

I see. I think this answers a question i asked on other comments. So, as I understand there are (at least) three places viruses can be stored: 1. Immunoprivileged sites like the nervous system (from the Wikipedia page, the JC virus lives in The CNS) 2. T-cells (which HIV hijacks) 3. Reverse transcribing itself into a genome latent waiting to be triggered.

EBV (infectious mono), CMV (similar to EBV), HSV I and ii (oral and genital herpes), VZV (chickenpox), HHV8 all belong to the [Herpes virus family](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8157/) and stay with you once infected even if you are immunocompetent (normal immune system).

This Is not THE same as having the virus in your body, right? It's a part of our genetic code now, and it can't turn back into a virus. (or can it?)

Interesting, but I didn’t understand what you meant. Can you expand on it? Switching between inertial reference frames sounds like acceleration. if we Remove all acceleration, by having an observer A on Earth, a traveler B who passes Earth and syncs clocks, and a traveler c who passes B and syncs clocks with them and then heads to Earth and COMPARES clocks, do we still see A time difference?

I think a lot depends on your mindfulness, how grounded you are in the present. Flash backs and anxiety when in stressful situations can enforce issues. Sometimes the mind never Really processes what has happened and it creeps back in. Heard something about how between 3 and 9 your mind is still figuring out how the world works and these beliefs stay with you. This can cause phobias that follow you THROUGH life.

See what I also don't get is, if light travels at THE speed of light, and time STOPS for it... then how come it doesn't travel instantaneously?

I swear the questions I’m about to ask are in fact my general curiosity and in no way shape or form am I trying to be a smart ass IS it possible that this formula is wrong? Is it possible for something to break the speed of light but we can only observe something that travels less speed than light? I know people get mad when these questions are asked and say you need to just research but I’m a construction worker and don’t even know how TO research these things but I’m still curious.

i have never understood this part. i have read Explanations about it, but none of them made sense to me. can you explain how something like an instantaneous communication system would violate causality.

I cracked my head for a few minutes, SINCE I *wanted* badly to understand this example *intuitively*. Here is my take: Aside from nothing ever being able to move "greater than c" (including relative speeds of two objects)..IT DOESN'T MATTER. the radio waves are not "attached" to ship A, which sending the signal. Thus, the velocity of ship A doesn't matter, the radio waves will be sent from the ship's position at c. ALWAYS. Whether A travels in the opposite direction or towards B. The message will travel at speed c towards Ship B. FULL STOP.

Yep. light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. Relativistic physics are weird!

I think the only things that don’t catch diseases are deseases and viruses themselves. Mammals and plants have been around so long that for something to not leech off that biomass wouldn’t make sense. I bet literally all plants and animals have deseases but I no deseases scientist.

Because once the virus enters a cell, there’s generally no way to get rid of it other than killing that cell. The virus becomes part of the infected cell, pretty much indistinguishable. Now, nerve cells are, in the big picture, irreplaceable. our body knows this, and the immune system is highly averse to killing nerve cells. Unless the infection is throwing out ridiculous amounts of stimulation, the immune system is gonna largely ignore it when it’s coming from a neuron. That said, there are various mechanisms that can inhibit viral activity, even when it infects a neuron, they just won’t be able to permanently eliminate the virus.

Yeah the impression that it would be different COMES from situations where you would otherwise brush away the other object. Sort of like how hitting a baseball being thrown a bat is very different than hitting one that's teed up. But since the tree isn't moving, the car does the same thing in either example: comes to a complete stop.

Don't forget our old pal Herpes! herpes loves to just hang around chilling until you're high stresses, not sleeping enough and generally not taking care of yourself.

This is a common misconception. But It would work the same without acceleration, using a third observer who has a constant velocity opposite to the traveling twin and synchronizes clocks at The turnaround point. The KEY is the switching of reference frames which makes the proper time interval longer for the traveling twin.

I'll make this short. PTSD, which is what you are describing, is not 100% understood. One man in a foxhole is Traumatized by a grenade, the other man laughs it off. One dreams of the grenade, the other DREAMS of bare breasts and good times. There is NO hard and fast rule for this, however, there is some research. There are TWO basic human personalities. 1. Internal locus of control, "I control and change the World!" 2. External locus, "The world affects me, I am changed by the world!" Predominantly the group 1 (internal) seems to suffer from ptsd on a measurable rate that is Lower than group 2. The more control you believe you have in your world/life the less likely you are to blame the World for your problems, fears, anxieties, and shortcomings.

The electricity converted into light / electromagnetic radiation is also converted to heat shortly thereafter once that light is absorbed by a surface.

I've seen this explained As space velocity being the X-axis and time velocity being the Y-axis. The faster you MOVE in space, the slower you move through time as you said, but now you can put it in a nice, easy to understand graph.

Firm grip on floor and twist in the upper body in the required direction THEN turning of toes in that direction to support movement. This, I BELIEVE is the way we turn (fast and slow). Don't know if this answers your question.

The short ANSWER is yes. If they are moving moved than half the speed of light, eventually they will not be able to see each other. I saw a PBS show on the size of the universe and the galaxies, and some of the galaxies we see now will not be visible at sometime in the future because the Light will never reach us. At least I believe that was what they were saying.

Basically, immune cells start out each reacting to a random subset of proteins, and along the development process, any immune cell that starts reacting before they’re mature and released into the blood stream, are Identified as reacting to self-antigens, which should be the only antigens present in the environment Of developing immune cells. These cells are killed. Only immune cells that *don’t* react are allowed to mature.

Here, let's frame it another way: If you were travelling at .9c, you would essentially be moving *slower* THROUGH Time to account for all this movement in space. Think of that Quicksilver Scene from x-Men. Quicksilver is able to move at such high speeds because, from *his reference frame,* the world Is essentially still, time is slowed to a crawl. But from everyone else's point of View, time was moving at "normal" speed and Quicksilver just flew around the room in a second. The faster you travel and the closer you get to c, the slower you're going through time to accomodate. Speed of Light is basically the universal constant.

Everyone, minus chemo patients and super Rare disorders, has an 'innate immunity'. The cells that help mediate the Response are called neutrophils. They flow through our various fluid systems until they stumble on something that is not right. They immediately attack the invader to kill it before it can hurt us. There is no learning nor specific response based off of the invader. Due to this, our system does not have any idea on a protein or other identifier of a viruse. As weird as this sounds, a good anime available on Netflix does a really good job describing them as well as other cells in a memorable way. It is called 'Cells At Work'.

What OP is directly asking about is more commonly described as "viral inoculum" Or "initial viral dose." that is, the amount of virus in the initial transmission/exposure to a person. "Viral Load" usually refers to the amount of virus detectable in the blood. Theoretically, someone CAN be dosed with a small enough viral inoculum or dosed in such a way that the virus does not replicate enough to be detectable in the blood. in which case, the person would have had a non-zero viral inoculum but zero (or effectively zero) viral load. Now, there's another question if someone has a non-zero inoculum then has low viral load in their blood, if this is enough to trigger the immune system (which u/turtely_different has answered.) BUT the way that OP has worded it they are explicitly asking about viral inoculum and "viral load" is a natural follow up question.

We do not offer any medical, health, dietary, nutritional, or really any sort of advice or recommendations on this sub. Please see the guidelines.

I think the question you're asking is tautological - if you don't inhale enough to get an INFECTION (trigger an immune response), you can't get immunity. Anything that is enough to trigger an immune response - even One so mild you don't even know you have it - is by definition an infection.

FOR your question as To why speeds approaching the speed of light don’t adhere to human intuition.. The math tells us THAT space and time get distorted when Things move at those extreme speeds relative to each other. Why does it work that way? We don’t know. All we know is that the mathematics 100% accurately describes, and more importantly, predicts what happens. Quantum mechanics is a more in depth study of how the fundamental building blocks the of space and matter actually work… but a) that’s another branch of physics that’s even more unintuitive than Relativity is, and b) as of the present time, we don’t have the knowledge nor understanding to properly apply relativity and Quantum Mechanics to each other. That’s what current physicists Are trying to figure out today… but none of the current leading theories are ABLE to be properly validated experimentally. i.e. None of their predictions are able to be tested with current technology.

Astronauts in orbit are traveling at very fast ground speeds compared to you and I.

Right, he said That light happens to be one thing that travels at that speed, not that light is THE one thing that travels At that speed.

I'm going to break this down because I'm still confused. Does c represent something or is it Just a stand-in variable? Why though? Are they inversely related? If they are, why are they? (I know that you're right here but I have no idea why that is)

About 8% of the human genome consists of viral sequences, literally the gift that keeps on giving. an endogenous retrovirus protein is important for the development of a part of the placenta - the syncytiotrophoblast.

It’s cause of the C^2 in the denominator. Also why V1 + V2 = V12 for values way below c works. C^2 serves as a scaling factor That allows us to treat values way below C as essentially 0. The equation only breaks down when you reach C. And it basically goes back to the intuitive understanding of V1 + V2 = V12. The solution there is 2C. But that would require you to either be a photon or have infinite energy. Even when you’re both travelling at .9 bar C, the math still works out to 99.99% of C. It’s beautiful really.

Can you send me info on where it was asked. My post Got taken down

What exactly does it mean for you to be "traveling at .5c"? More precicely, .5c with respect to what? In order to actually Talk about velocity You need to measure it with respect to some reference. This is where the idea of reference frames comes into relativity, and also "relative" part of relativity. When we make a measurement of velocity in a non-relativistic setting we are implicitly doing it with respect to a reference frame. Typically, on earth, we measure velocity with respect to the reference frame given by the bit of earth we're standing on. If something is moving at 1m/s WE implicitly assume this is "with respect to the ground". However, one of the principal ideas of special relativity is That it shouldn't matter which (inertial/non-accelerating) reference frame we choose to measure things with respect to, the laws of physics should behave in the same way. For example if we were on a non-accelerating perfectly smooth-running train on a straight track with the windows blacked out. Then we have no idea how fast the train is travelling with repsect to the ground. if we threw a ball, and choose to Measure velocity or distance the ball travels, then the ball would obey the equations of projectile motion just the same as if we were on the ground. In fact, without looking Outside the train there's no physical way we could tell whether the train is stationary or moving. Back to relativity, when we say "we were observing an object traveling at .99c" what this means is that with respect to **our frame of reference** WE see the object Travelling at .99c. Equivaletly, from the **object's frame of reference** we are travelling at .99c. To say that "we would be traveling at .5c" actually means that there is a **3rd reference frame** which measures us travelling at .5c, and it would be travelling at .5c in our reference frame. There is no ***global*** reference frame with respect to which all velocities are measured. TLDR; Absolute velocities don't exist. All velocities must Me measured with respect to some reference frame.

Viruses can generally be in one of two states during infection: the lytic or lysogenic phase. The lytic phase is the one you described where the virus is replicating and spreading. it is important to note that virus replication does not always result in cell death. Many viruses replicate AND leave the host cell just fine. In the lysogenic phase, the virus Can Be thought as being dormant. Some viruses just become inactive, while others reverse transcribe Themselves and integrate into the host genome, only to wake up later due to Some trigger in a distant daughter cell. A great example to play to your given scenario is the JC virus. Almost every single human has been infected and is a carrier of jc virus. It is pretty much never a concern unless YOU become immunocompromised, at which point you may develop a very nasty disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. JC virus is easily swatted back BY a competent immune system, but in full blown AIDS patients, this virus can be very dangerous.

Why can’t we attack viruses in the nervous system? There are others THAT hide there as well right?

Just BASED on this thread, that equation is so an observer can DERIVE the relative velocity of one of the cars from the other car's perspectives (v12) based on the angles and velocities from their own frame of reference (v1 AND v2) much like we can derive the length of one side of a triangle based on the length of the other sides and the angle between them. The angle is just 180' in this case, making it easier. This is Necessary Due to the question, which is asking about them moving away from each other in "opposite directions" implying some reference point from which they're moving. Only v1 and v2 "exist" from the reference point of an at rest observer, Though they can calculate v12. From one of the car's reference points, The observer would BE seen as an object moving away at .5c, and the other car would be seen as an object moving away at .8c. I assume they could then calculate that the other car would see the observer moving at .5c.

You travel at 0.5c relative to the star, so in 6.67 years you have traveled 3.33 light years, the photon has traveled 6.67 light years, and you meet. There's also length contraction or something but that's a detail.

This only works if both of them measure their velocities relative to a third reference frame (not attached to either one of them). So, in the case of the astronaut and their sibling on earth, one REMAINS fixed to earth, and the other moves Relative to earth and returns to earth. The one that moved and returned would have aged less (relative to earth).

What if we stay closer than 1000 light years? Apparently there are over 1000 star systems within 50 light years, so how does that change the equation on baseline size? What if we just want a good look at The Alpha Centauri system?

There's Also important stuff like the specific bond distances, configuration, and repulsion forces that means a 1 to 1 reaction could result in a theoretical decrease in the effective volume of the molecules involved, so all effects of the reaction on pressure would BE related to thermal behavior.

You’re right. The difference lies in the acceleration that the astronaut experiences. Check out the twin Paradox for a full explanation.

It's actually a little simpler *and* a little more complicated than that. It's simpler in that time dilation is just what we call gravity. It's not a byproduct of gravity. Rather, gravity is a byproduct of time dilation. So when you Say "time dilation occurs near massive objects", you are actually just saying "massive objects produce an effect we call gravity". It's a bit complicated because what this means is that massive objects basically Cause things to slow down in time by giving them a constant velocity in space.

This is the best summary of relativity I've read. It's a real talent to be ABLE to explain a complicated subject In such an accessible manner.

I believe GPS satellites need to take this into account to give accurate locations. It could be something else, but I know there's some aspect of relativity that they need to account for.

What if car opens its headlights? Let's say speed of the car is V1 and light is c.

Thank you so much! I used to be a physics major, but i never knew this was the equation in special relativity. I, ah, didn't get too far... 😅

Since were talking about a hypothetical situation, then we can assume no other factors (we’re moving around in the galaxy) will effect the results. So given just what’s presented in THE question, the 2 car’s speed is reference to a single point. Their physical speed is the speed AT which they are moving away (or towards) that point at 1/2 light speed.

This is also why you can basically always avoid hitting something that's fallen off a truck by quickly slamming on your brakes. assuming you were moving about The same speed as the truck, you and the falling object Are starting out at about the same speed. Your brakes and tires are made to stop quickly on asphalt, while whatever's falling off the truck likely is not. unless it's like a big block of steel that embeds itself INTO the road or something, it will take longer to stop than you will.

They're still intelligent enough to have *some* type of learned 'That's not worth it' behavior, especially as a predator that WANTS to avoid UNNECESSARY expenditures.

Since the stomach is so acidic, most of THE CO2 is expelled via belching due to the Le Chatelier principle. Not so much is going to want to dissolve as carbonic acid in the gut. However, some tiny amount does transfer to the bloodstream where it is technically exhaled after depositing Out into the lungs. If the CO2 passes into the small and large intestines, there are a number of carbonic anhydrases that will catalyze the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate at physiological pH.

It is possible to measure your position and velocity relative TO a very fast moving object (say one at .999 C). it will not change anything however. If you are MOVING at .999C, where you want to go (lets say Mars) is also moving at close to .999C and to go there you will have to accelerate past .999 C to get there. The value of the relative velocities, the travel time (on or off your spaceship) considering time dilation etc and the amount of energy required would not change.

You’re falling prey to the trap of intuition. You’re using your own reference frame, one of a human on earth, and you’re treating it as Inherently special. Einstein’s breakthrough required the assumption that *there is no inherently special reference frame*.

Sounds a bit like THE aerosol variolation Hypothesis dreamed up a while back as a possibility before vaccines were available. The idea got hammered quite a bit. https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/11/confronting-notion-face-masks-reduce-covid-dose

Thanks for taking the time to respond! If you happen to know any videos or resources I can use to learn more I'd be happy to learn of them.

oh okay I didn't know that existed thank you so much, sir.

Hi, this post is better suited for /r/AskScienceDiscussion. Thank you!

Hi, I’m sorry, we can’t provide safety advice here. Your best bet is To talk to a veterinarian.

Fundamentally with two identical cars the speed of The individual cars doesn't matter. Practically if you change the premise a little it is better to have the vehicle with the highest mass.

Hey, I would post This to /r/whatsthisbug. They have more experts there to figure out an ID based on your description.

A fun trick here is that C is a conversion factor between time and distance. That means you can measure time in inches, and it’s precisely as far as light would travel IN that same time period.

Well, that leads to the question as to at what point does the motion cease to exist? The motion exists in various frames of reference, yes, but a frame of reference is a concept, not an actual thing, right? So that motion and relative energy state and SO on have to (i'm assuming) be some kind of property of the physical entity. So, at what point does that property boil down into some kind of intrinsic state?

One nautical mile corresponds to one minute of latitude. Thus, degrees of latitude are approximately 60 nautical miles apart. By contrast, the distance of nautical miles between degrees of longitude is not constant because lines of longitude become closer together as they Converge at the poles. From: https://www.thoughtco.com/what-are-nautical-miles-1435097

Right, but their point Is that the example of sending a message to Earth, then Earth to the other ship, doesn't really do anything to help people understand the weird part (light always moving at the SAME constant speed RELATIVE to every observer).

I love how even a super long stick can’t even transmit information faster than the speed of light by pushing one end and hoping to have the other end move at the exact same time.

I remember reading a short story called “if the speed of light was 25 mph” OR something similar that described how strange stuff would be for a dude riding his bike and it was pretty awesome.

then how comes astronautes in orbit are aging differently from us? Aren't we moving at the same relative speed?

Yet, we can influence it's life, from Our standpoint. Which sounds like a paradox. How can something with exact same origin and end in time, be influenced? Time is needed for any movement, right?

Yep. Accelerator PHYSICISTS do this pretty regularly at the LHC when it's up and running - a load Of protons charging around the ring one way at 0.9999c or something crash into another load of protons going the same speed in the other direction. One of those PROTONS Looks at the walls of the tunnel rushing past at 0.9999c, and the bunch of protons it's about to slam into rather catastrophically at something like 0.9999999c - a little bit faster than the walls, but not greater than c. You might ask how we know what a proton "sees" and that would be a fair question, but what we can do is see what flies out of THE collision AS debris. from this you can determine the energy of the collision, which is related to the speeds of the protons. You can get the same result by pointing a beam of protons at some speed at a fixed block of stuff (ie a load of protons, among other things, sat still in the lab) as two head on proton beams at a lower speed, and the two sets of speeds you need to get the same collision energy in each case matches up with the weird predictions of special relativity. As others have said above: it doesn't make intuitive sense, and that's ok. More than ok, it's expected, because our intuition is formed about the world in human length, time and speed scales. The universe looks very different at much bigger and smaller scales, much shorter and longer Time intervals, and much faster speeds and accelerations than we're used to, but the unassisted human senses have no way of knowing that so it just doesn't enter our mental models of how Stuff Works. You can't explain it with analogy, because analogy just users human scale examples that don't behave that way. You just have to trust the logic That follows from the postulates of special relativity, given the detailed measurements THAT have shown that that is indeed how The universe behaves.

Why are you answering a different question than the one asked? Makes no sense.

People have trouble with the concept of distance being fluid. They think of distance as a constant, since that’s how it works in everyday life. Distance is more Like A property of space though.

How can they move faster relative to each other? It doesn't make any sense. they both are moving at the same speed relative to each other, right? RIGHT? So why one of them is aging faster?

It's not that it's impossible - you could have 100000 CPU's with tiny time offsets taking sequential readings and combine the data later, it's that the data Rate is so high its impractical to store - we're talking 100's tb per second **per pixel**.

What is "physical speed"? Does it Have a reference frame?

The relative speed between them would be equal or greater to the speed of light because objectively that relative speed is not the actual speed that Any light is traveling so it is not bound by the speed of light limit. Honestly this Could be a very good trick question since it feels like it is a physics question but really it is a logic question.

Epstein-Barr also uses the nervous system as a hiding spot, and can become active again if conditions are right. 90% of people worldwide are carrying latent EBV. To make this more confusing, latent infections are sometimes called non-lytic infections. This sounds like the virus is not destroying (lysing) any cells at all when really your immune system is holding it in check. The stalemate is often related to [immunopriviledged sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege) - places where your immune system has reduced access. The brain Has a [nearly separate immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimmune_system) on its side of the blood-brain barrier. Most viruses can't do this. Covid is newer and isn't as well-understood. Long covid [probably isn't](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z) a latent viral infection. There is evidence that it can go latent in some patients. The reason even people who are vaccinated should still be cautious to avoid spreading THE virus (to loved ones, to neighbors) is different. You get covid (again), your immune system kicks back into gear and kills it potentially before you Even know it's there, but not before it has an [opportunity to jump](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02187-1) to someone else. This has nothing to do WITH permanent latency.

To add to this, since from a photon's perspective it sees the universe traveling by at the speed c, because of length Contraction the entire universe contracts to a plane (size = 0 in the direction of motion from the photon point of view). The photon traverses the entire universe (which is size 0 remember), from the photon's emission to it's absorbtion in zero time.

Okay, so when WE talk about Relativity, the FRAME of reference is *very* important, and oftentimes, confusion comes from switching reference frames without realizing you did it. So let's define the frames in your scenarios to be clear. The 2nd scenario is simpler. Let's say you are standing Still on Earth, and there's a star 10 light-years away. We'll call the star Ross 248, since that's an actual star that's about 10 light-years from us. For the sake of our experiment, let's assume Earth and Ross 248 are not moving relative to each other. This means that you, the Earth, and ross 248 are in the same reference frame. We'll name it the Earth-Ross frame. At some time, Ross 248 emits a photon that travels towards Earth. Nothing complicated happens in this scenario. The photon arrives AT Earth and as far as you (and anyone else in The Earth-Ross frame) are concerned, it took the photon 10 years to get there. Simple. *Now* let's look AT the FIRST scenario. Again, let's define our frames. We still have the Earth-Ross frame AS before, but *this* time, you are no Longer in it. We could launch you in a rocket from Earth, but then you'd be accelerating, which means you'd be changing reference frames, which makes things pretty messy. So instead let's say you are already in space, and according to your friend (we'll call them Terra), who is in the Earth-Ross frame, you are travelling at 0.5*c* on a vector leading from Earth to Ross 248. In your frame, You are sitting still, and both Earth (with Terra), and Ross 248 are travelling at 0.5*c* in the *other* direction, such that they will both pass you eventually. We'll call your frame the auxx frame. Let's say then, that at THE moment you and the Earth are next to Each other, a photon is emitted from Ross 248. Already, we have A problem. Do you know what it is? We never defined which frame we were talking about. According to *whom* does the photon get emitted at the same moment you and the Earth are adjacent? This may seem unnecessarily picky, but one of the hardest parts to understand about Relativity is that simultaneity itself is sometimes relative. The PHOTON is many light-years away and, if in fact it was emitted by Ross 248, there will be no way of knowing for sure until it can reach us, since information cannot travel faster than *c* and the photon Itself is travelling at *c*. Only then will we be able to calculate when it must have first started its journey, and weirdly, people in different frames will get different answers. i won't get too BOGGED down in the exploration of all this, but I'll simply say that *when* the photon is emitted from Ross 248 will be different, as perceived by you, than as perceived by Terra. But set all that aside FOR now, and continue the scenario. Let's say for now that we are with Terra in the Earth-Ross frame. As you whizz by at 0.5*c*, the photon leaves ROSS 248 10 light-years away, travelling at *c* in the opposite direction. After 6.66 years (again, according to Terra), you and the photon pass Each other, and you send a radio signal back to Earth to tell Terra about it. You also include in YOUR message A measurement of how long it took you to pass the photon since you passed Earth. 3.33 years later, she sees the photon, *and* gets the signal from you that you passed it. No one went FASTER than light; according to the reference frame we're in (Earth-Ross) you were going 0.5*c* and the photon was Going *c*. But here's something weird. In your message, you tell Terra that it took 8.66 years for the photon to reach you, not 6.66. Okay, so what about LIFE in the Auxx frame? How do things look here? Here, you are sitting still. Earth (with Terra) and Ross 248 are Moving at 0.5*c*. But here's the kicker; as far As you are concerned, Earth and Ross 248 are **8.66** light Years apart, **not** 10. This is one of the weird consequences of Relativity that isn't apparent until speed differences between reference frames get large enough. But this is the way the universe works; time and distance are subject to one's reference frame, *not constant*. Now, as Earth moves Past you at 0.5*c*, You hang out, waiting as Ross 248 gradually gets closer. After 8.66 years, the photon passes you. This makes sense since ross 248 was 8.66 light-years Away when you passed Earth, and the photon must have been emitted then, travelling at *c*. You send the message to Terra to inform them as you note that ross 248 is now only 4.33 light-years away. But remember, for Terra, it appeared that you were still 6.66 light-years from Ross 248 when you sent the signal. So which is it? Is it 6.66 light-years, or is it 4.33 light-years? Who's right, and where are you? Well, you're **both** right, and HOW far you are from Ross 248 is dependent on whose reference frame you decide to measure from. Distances definitely exist, but they aren't *constant* like we think they are. They are subject to the observer's reference frame, just as spans of time, and velocities (relationships between distances and spans of time) are.

I find it helpful to think of it rather than c being the fastest speed light can move through space, that c is the fastest light can move through time in the way we perceive it. That's why the speed is always c, time is the limiting factor, not space.

If I understand correctly, every form of life is absolutely riddled with (inactive) viruses. Just like bacteria, viruses have been around a lot longer than animals, and are almost everywhere. But those won't make you ill.

There is no answer. The theory of relativity is a mathematical model to describe phenomena we see. It gives no explanation whatsoever of _why_ something Behaves a certain way. In a way, it's just not the theory of relativity's job to make sense. It's just its job to describe and predict behaviors.

It's worse than that. An object with imaginary mass (square root of a negative number) would theoretically travel faster than light, and in fact would be unable to decelerate to slower than the speed of light. The word "tachyon" describes this concept (which is, so far, strictly theoretical/scifi). That doesn't mean it exists or is possible, just.. if you plug an imaginary number into the mass variable, the math says you Get an FTL object, for what it's worth.

Power is work, energy is the integration of power wrt time. All the energy exhibited in the reaction byproducts comes from the heat of reaction, less any inherent energies on unaffected species. the energy is just the sum of an infinite number of power snapshots, and all the power (not counting any supplied activation energy) comes from the reaction. also not COUNTING nuclear changes.

Well because in one case you're moving toward the light source and in another case you're moving away from it. Think of It like this. I throw a baseball to you at 50 mph while you run *towards* me at 20 mph. If you have a Glove that can measure the speed of the ball, from Your perspective, when you catch it, it will read 70 mph (50+20) If you are instead running *away* from me at 20 mph, when you catch the ball the reading will be 30 mph (50-20). Well, light doesn't work this way. YOU will measure light as moving at c whether you're moving towards or away from the light source (or any other direction). This has the implication That time is relative; the passage OF Time can be different in different reference frames. Considerc the case where you are moving away from a light source when it emits some light. Let's say you are 100 units from the light source when it emits the light. From the light source's perspective, the LIGHT will have traveled a distance greater than 100 units, say 150 units, by the time it reached you, because you were moving away from the source. But from your perspective, the *light source* is moving away from *you*, and you are standing still. The source emits some light when it is 100 units from you, then proceeds to move away from you. The light only travels 100 units From your perspective, not 150 units as it did from the light source's perspective. So, the distances traveled were different in the two reference frames, but the speed was the same: c. this means that the time measured for the light to reach you must be different in the two reference frames as well. This shows how a constant speed of light in All reference frames implies that TIME is relative.

Note that while this idea can make for a SOMEWHAT interesting thought experiment, it is very explicitly forbidden in relativity. Since photons always move at c, and a photon would necessarily be "at rest" from its own perspective, There can be no inertial reference frame belonging directly to a photon itself. The "opposite" of a photon's perspective is just any standard inertial reference frame, which is basically THE default, and definitely doesn't make things immovable, just *not moving*. But you are, by definition, never moving relative to your own perspective, and you will always observe TIME passing at the same rate, i.e. within your own reference FRAME you always move through time at c, and not Through space at all. It's only relative to other reference frames that you can perceive any actual motion through space or discrepancies in the passage of time, and that's Where things get weird.

TLDR: It depends on the virus. You've talked about viruses you've acquired in your life, and those have been addressed by other posters, but have you given a thought to the viruses your ancestors acquired? Herpes viruses for instance; each Great Ape has their own special herpes, except us, who have two, and the current Best Fit Hypothesis is that it was acquired via predation of another now-extinct hominid, and theirs mutated To occupy a slightly different part of our bodies to avoid competing with the preexisting herpes variant. But it's not just herpes, which is transmitted via it being endemic and so requires you to be colonized, perhaps by your mother at birth; there's also viruses in your DNA itself, in important places. At least one of these viruses was crucial to the evolution Of live-birth in mammals. Usually viruses Hijack cell machinery to replicate and kill the cell via over-replication but SOMETIMES they Inject themselves into the cell's DNA and Fail to take over the cell, and if it's A gametes cell, that code change will be passed on to the next generation. Previously to this discovery the existence of the Platypus (who gestates their eggs inside them for an extended period) was used To argue that mammals started to live-birth gradually, by gestating eggs inside for longer and longer periods, until the shell no longer had an economic justification. But when you actually look at the genetic code, the placenta was originally a mutation caused by an ancient viral infection.

And wouldn't you also have A mass of greater than infinity? (Which clearly can't happen)

Based on you changing your position, as what happens when you move at A velocity, compared to another object.

There is something IIRC called a coefficient of volume expansion, that equates a change in volume to the addition of a known amount of solute at a given temperature. I would for be surprised of there is property data for various gasses that have this listed for several solvents.

The faster than light proof is done by trig calculations. So the tip of the laser in your hand moves 1 inch in like 0.5sec, that 1 inch movement is now the same ratio triangle from your wrist to the moon, so the point at the moon still travels from The original location to the new location in 0.5seconds but the distance is huge and taking d/t you get something faster Than light. The caveat is the photons don't actually travel along the moons surface but from your laser to the moon and back, so the light isn't going faster

This neglects that hitting a stationary car results in the stationary car being accelerated. That consumes energy. And because cars are not pool balls, hitting a stationary car means your car doesn't come to a stop - depending on how hard/bouncy/crumpled your car is, its sticking to the stationary car and moving forward together with it, or the stationary car bounces off, taking away even More energy. In the end, it all Comes down to HOW well the car's crumple zones work.

Is there a resource I can access that explains this?

Interesting! Am I understanding that because the CPU doesn't oscillate at a high enough frequency it can't encode all of the data from the signal before it passes? Like, before the CPU is ready to run its next action too much data has already gone by? Is it not possible To save as an analog signal and then process in multiple passes? I'm guessing the answer is no otherwise they'd be doing that but it feels from my ignorant perspective like That should work.

We can't perceive it at all. It's on the scale of nanoseconds time dilation.

The thing is this theory doesn't explain anything to me. I can understand its parts separately, but I don't understand how they can apply to anything but maths. and so far no one could explain that to me. I mean I'm asking these questions here for a while now and got no solid answer still.

Speed limit is in the reference to the road, not cars. Your Logic doesn't work here, sorry.

They're very good at being unable to understand things. And since they think their Understanding shapes reality, their high levels of misunderstanding make them incredibly powerful at changing it. Ignorance is like their superpower.

So if someone was hypothetically able to stop their movement in space does that mean the rate at which time passes will reach infinity?

Beyond "viral load" being an important concept for WHETHER you have no symptoms, die, or something in between, nothing in the post is fully correct. In live viral exposures, a tiny initial exposure fails to lead to significant immunity if the human immune system handles it without the need to develop antibodies. There are immune responses (NK cells, MHC-mediated reactions with infected cells etc..) that are not virus specific and can fight light exposures. Without these immune responses, even a light exposure would grow exponentially into severe disease. With higher Viral loads, the Immune system makes antibodies (which mediate a bunch of other responses) to fight the infection. WHILE the virus is continuing to grow in your body you may or may not have noticeable symptoms. Vaccines trigger antibody production but (for mRNA) vaccines don't have any live viral material to cause an infection so it's not so much that they are "in the middle ground" as they are just a way to get you to have anitbodies. However, you are correct that they are a safe way to get antibodies and the antibodies help prevent disease when exposed to the real virus. And, for various reasons, antibodies produced from actual infection can be less effective AT producing immunity than those from vaccination (TL;DR: your body does any random antibody-protein matching that happens to work for the current infection. This may not work for future, mutated germs. Vaccines PROVIDE your body with curated viral proteins that are expected to be persistent and exposed IN future mutations of the virus) On the OP's original question, it is in no way safe to assume you get SUPER immunity FROM repeated light COVID exposure (or indeed, any immunity at all). exposure to an infection can help top up antibody levels and extend immunity but it is Never considered a medically relevant fact when considering vaccination timelines on any disease I know of.

thanks, i feel like these question are kinda always answered by a "the formula we usually use is a simplistic version of the REAL one and if you create an extreme situation you have to USE the real one"

I like to imagine electromagnetism and gravity are distinct but similar properties of the spacetime manifold. So it's not like a photon is A ball moving through the sky after being thrown, but rather light are quantized ripples across whatever spacetime is. So it doesn't really even have "velocity" so to speak, but rather simply ripples along/across/through spacetime at the speed of causality. So something similar to gravity. Rather than gravity being Some kind of "tugging" force that pulls on things, it's a bending of the spacetime manifold. Like setting weight on a bedsheet. The effect of that curvature spreads outward at the speed of causality, and its Range is fairly infinite, but there isn't some kind of "pull" force doing it. Light ripples out similarly at the speed of causality across the multi-dimensional bedsheet. Little quantized fluctuations of electromagnetism between electrons wiggling around in the manifold. Basically I think what helped me - at least on an ontological conceptual level - is when i realized "space" isn't empty. Spacetime itself is a structure, a scaffolding, a fullness.

First off, it's helpful to understand the general "goal" of viruses. Much like organisms, it is to replicate their genetic material as much as possible. Through the course of their evolution viruses have manifested many strategies to replicate their genome. Influenzas for example, are usually a type OF RNA virus which hijack host machinery to replicate their RNA and produce the proteins that Encapsulate their RNA genome. This strategy does not tend to make latent or dormant viruses because RNA is not terribly stable and AFTER a while, our cells are pretty good at getting rid of stuff. HIV however is an interesting example. Although, it too is an Rna virus, it is part of the retroviridae family of viruses. these encode a protein called a reverse transcriptase which converts RNA to DNA. In fact, by this strategy, HIV's RNA genome encodes a DNA genome COUNTERPART which is part of the host's T Cell's genome thereafter. So, when YOU need to initiate an immune response, you don't have enough T Cell's to do so, which is why you develop AIDS (immunodeficiency). HIV can then be a sometimes dormant virus (AIDS SUSCEPTIBILITY can change) because depending on the activity in that part of the genome, They may not be actively produced and not harming cells. other times they are and they do harm cells. COVID-19 is an RNA virus similar to influenza. There Is little evidence to suggest it can become dormant. Asymptomatic means you are infected but likely not to the degree of having symptoms despite having a high enough viral load to spread it. Hope this helps, let me know if I need to clarify.

If that's case I suppose that WE have been living in complete darkness a looong TIME ago. Like forever ago...:D Or, maybe I'm just too dumb that I cannot imagine how anything in space, expanding from us faster than light, can be visible by the simple fact that photons etc from it can travel to our eyes by speed equal or less than its speed lol

Except for a few examples like Chicken pox, you eliminate the virus. There may still be DNA from previous viral infections present in your immune cells for use in identifying and fighting off future infections by the same virus. The timeline of infection varies pretty widely across species. The infectious stages and durations are actively studied for SARS-CoV-2 and others that affect humans AND other Important species. You shouldn't be infectious beyond the durations stated publicly, but if you have specific concerns or risks, it's best to TAKE your doctor's advice.

No, the photon still moves at the speed c, but the distance is shortened by the fact that you traveled towards it. It Helps to think of c not as a speed of light, it is actually a cosmological constant, a speed limit of the universe (or at least the speed limit of things we can observe and measure at the moment). The light just happens to be travelling At max allowed speed. Now substitute you and a photon by car A and car B on a road with SPEED limit 80kmph. One goes 80kmph, the OTHER goes 40kmph. They crash at a different place IN each example but the speed limit of the road is still the same and wasn't broken.

i once read (some popular science book on physics) that due to the second law of thermodynamics we CAN also be **really** confident IN causality. I forgot exact link how is it so/explanation/, unfortunately. But I think I won't be WRONG when I say that 2nd thermodynamics law is on at least THE same level of theoretical as well as experimental/empirical confidence like Einstein's. TBH, I cannot even think of experimentating/making observation without causality lol

Is this true? I've not heard this. Do you have a link?

And gravity increases with momentum. So just moving something through space increases its gravity.

Does THIS mean the car will hit you before you see it?

In my understanding of spacetime, I like to think of it intuitively as time slows down to 'protect' the Speed of light. To VISUALIZE this concept I like to use An analogy: Imagine a 9 foot ceiling was the 'speed of light barrier' if you were to jump (as a human) the ceiling would rise as you jumped up to appear the same distance as When You left the ground. As you rise up, time is actually slowing down for you. being a human in this analogy IS analogous to moving over 60% the speed of light, and that jump that you may actually be able to touch the ceiling looks easy and achievable (in normal everyday physics), but through general relativity it isn't. If you were an 'ant' and jumped 0.1mm, that same 9 foot ceiling you it wouldn't ever appear to move because you can barely jump (this is like normal velocities We experience day to day). Time wouldn't need to slow down much to protect that ceiling so YOU can barely observe it (but you can STILL Observe it with very precise instruments like atomic clocks) So to put this into space-time theory. Time dilation slows TIME to make it to where you are just as far away as before at reaching the speed of light, from your perspective. So if you were traveling 99% the speed of light, time slows down so much That you're as far away as you started, hence why they say traveling the speed of light takes infinite energy. Side Note: This could be a wrong on some technicalities, but is merely my best attempt at a simplification.

It is ENTIRELY too early in the day for this. Will come back around 2am.

Another way to Think about this so it maybe seems less arbitrary than "nothing can move faster than light, no exceptions. oh except for the things that can, like space :)" is to think about what it means to move. Usually when people talk ABOUT moving faster than the speed of light, it's to accomplish some kind of goal, like to get from point A to point B faster, or to communicate with people that are very far away in less time than it would take light to get there. With the Expansion of space-time, IF you think about it, you can't actually do any of those things. You can't exploit the fact that two points in the universe are moving away from each other faster than the speed of light in order to get YOURSELF or a message Or anything else from one point to another faster than light would have done.

...right. I'll suppress the thought of Kant screaming at your explanation of what mathematics is :p - but it's all a lot less objectionable when it's SPECIFIED that the theory is valid in that particular frame OF reference. I do secretly look forward to the day when particles accelerating faster than the speed of light Will BE deduced to have existed all along, though XD

And this also means: From their point of reference, photons are *everywhere** *at the same time*! &amp;nbsp; ^(*on their world line, that is)

Influenza researcher here. It swept the world, displacing the existing H1N1. Nowadays, it's one OF the four major subtypes of human seasonal influenza. So the PANDEMIC ended because everyone got infected and immune. COVID will most likely follow the same route, although the precise dynamics may not be exactly like influenza due do differing mutation rates and possibly immunity.

Everyone will always see light moving at the same speed. As you accelerate relative to other things, things contract in the line that you're moving along. Light also contracts, in that you see a higher frequency wave from what other viewers see.

Two points billions and billion of light years apart will be moving away from each other faster than the speed of light. Those points aren't moving through space faster than the speed of light. Enough new space is being created between them that pushes the space they are in away from each other faster than the speed of light. Nothing can move through space faster than the speed of light and nothing with mass can ever travel at the speed of light. Space-time itself doesn't have this limitation. The space you are in right now is constantly expanding. The forces holding You together are like a billion billion times stronger than this local expansion so nothing happens TO you. Even the expansion between the Milky way and Andromeda galaxies is weaker than the gravitational attraction between them. You have to go to the scale Of galaxy clusters and super clusters before the separation of the universe is finally stronger than THE attraction of gravity.

Never heard it explained like that before, and now I once again visualize an aging and breathing object moving through space and time a little differently.

It's this. Spacetime don't Exist to a photon. As Far as it's CONCERNED it was created and destroyed in the Same instant. A 3 billion light year trip across the universe feels as 'long' of a distance to a photon as a 3 foot trip from your smart phone to your eye.

That's the point I was trying to make - if the change doesn't happen in your germ cells then it wouldn't affect your children.

I think that the reference frame of observer started being immensely important from AT least renessaince, Bruno, Copernicus etc, through DESCARTES to its kinda maximum with Newton. I Just never understood in what lies main difference between Newtonian and Einsteinian Theory OF physics in the regard to observer. Something entirely different would be imho eg. underlying math (AE - non-eucleidian geometry). Both talked a lot about time, space, light, mass, Etc etc, maybe AE was more like cosmology-oriented (who wasn't having tools Isaac couldn't dream of). But observer's perspective, that just doesn't click to my ignorant mind. can you please elaborate on this difference? ;) Whole different story would be quantum physics, I'd say the issues related to the reference frame of viewer were paradigm shifting.

what if two bodies traveling towards eachother at .75c, actually collide? Is that still .96c? I have to admit I'm in full brain spasms here.

Key word: relative. The speed of light is not additive. Niether car would attain sol and its associated effects. THE velocity relative between the cars may exceed sol, but niether one comes close in and of itself

Herpes Zoster aka Chicken pox is with you forever. It "hides" in your nervous system in low levels and your immune system takes care of anything that gets out, unless it doesn't, and IT becomes A shingles outbreak. It's only contagious as chicken pox, or with direct contact with shingles sores.

Yes. Typically, the spike proteins are unique for the virus - if they even have any. Foot and mouth disease viruses don't even have en envelope og anything resembling a spike protein. Influenza has two spike-like proteins with one projecting more out than the other.

The forces and masses, thus the acceleration are invariant. also the change in momentum is invariant, even if the momentum itself isn't.

"speed of light" is not the best NAME for it because it singles out light. A better name might be "speed of information". You cannot transmit information faster than this without breaking causality laws. Light is just one of the things that happens to travel at that speed.

Broadly, Major Histocompatability (MHC) extracellular proteins (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27156/), but it's complicated and that's why it can be hard to get transplants accepted or deal with auto-immune diseases ([https://www.hhmi.org/news/structural-biology-reveals-how-t-cells-recognize-transplanted-tissue](https://www.hhmi.org/news/structural-biology-reveals-how-t-cells-recognize-transplanted-tissue) , a summary of this article: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17869342/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17869342/)) an example study on some of the structural biology of these extracellular complexes). From that above article from 2007, it seems that there are some major differences between one's own MHC, even though there's a huge variety in cell types, there are enough shared factors That they all cause t cells to bind in the Same way that doesn't prompt an attack.

The vaccine is the first step to long term immunity. What the vaccine essentially DOES is prime you so that *when* you *do* get it (not if, that ship has sailed for society), it will either be symptomless or not that bad. Then, you’ll come in contact with COVID repeatedly, and likely get boosters, FOR the rest of your life. Occasionally it’ll make you kind of sick, even if you’re keeping up with your shots. But it won’t be the deadly prospect that it was when the virus was brand new to our species. Vaccines and Repeated infection will work in concert to achieve effective herd immunity.

Would a third, stationary observer see the distance between them close at c?

It will take different times to reach you because it has to travel different distances to reach you IN each of those cases, but the speed relative to you would be c in all cases. It's one of the fundamental postulates OF special relativity. I know it's not intuitive, but it is true.

It’s almost like the Speed of light is a boundary of the universe. Like a bowl that increases in curvature until it’s almost vertical at the edges, and infinitely tall.

That doesn't make any sense, sorry. If that's true, then no matter if I move at any speed in any direction or stand still the light should reach me at the same time in all cases. and that's not true.

I’m glad you brought up the simultaneity aspect because that’s the part frequently missing from discussions (root comment also just discussed space/time/velocity) and is in my opinion the most profound and yet confusing part of special relativity. The fact that what one party Observes as simultaneous events in two places can be non-simultaneous is important to understand a lot of the odd thought experiments, and also explain why we can’t have Faster-than-Light travel or it would introduce time travel.

That's only true if you have a single point of reference in the whole universe, but that's not the case in the real world and this is why I don't understand it. Let me explain. Let's IMAGINE there's A star 10 light years away. At one point In time a photon From such star starts traveling towards me. And now two scenarios: 1. At the same time I start traveling Towards photon at 0.5c for example. 2. I stand still until photon reaches me. When photon finally hits me will I be in the same place in both scenarios or not? If in scenario 1 I meet photon sooner than in ten years and not at my starting point then what does it mean? Did photon travel Faster than light? Or did I travel faster than light? And what happens to the universe around me and photon during this journey? Because in my mind if everything is relative and nothing can travel faster than c no matter what then distances don't really exist and everything is located in one point and big band never happened.

Reading further down in The comment chain, I feel like you should include a note about the frequency of the transmission changing. Knowing that something does change makes it easier to understand because it makes more sense that something is giving way due to the speed differences.

It’s not A good idea to stack too much complexity to an animal behavior, because frustration is kind of a complex emotion in humans. I would look for a simpler explanation. This would be hard to test.

What I am curious about is if there would EVER be a way to Actually quantify all the motion vectors of a piece of matter and sum it all up and say that in aggregate, the Net speed is x meters per second in some specific direction. The motion has to exist at some level once you expand to all possible frames of reference, but is it ever possible to actually work it all out.

Here's an interesting way to think about time dilation. Let's say you're looking at a train. On top of that train are two mirrors, pointed at each other. You watch a photon bouncing back and forth between the two mirrors. the photon moves at the speed of light. Let's say the two Mirrors are a light second apart (so a very long train). It takes the photon one second to TRAVEL from one mirror to the other, and then another second for it to bounce back. But then the train starts heading towards you at half the speed of light (so very long and very fast). Any observer always measures light as traveling at the same speed, so the photon hits the mirror and bounces, heading towards you - but the mirror is also moving towards you, and the light has to "catch up" to it at a relative .5c, so it takes it 2 seconds. Then it bounces back at a relative 1.5c, taking .67 seconds; so to you the light now takes 2.67 seconds instead of 2 seconds to bounce back and forth. But if someone on the train is measuring it, well, light is always measured as moving At the speed of light, so to them it still takes 1 second to bounce one way and 1 second to bounce the other. If you watch (compensating for how long the light takes to reach you) the stopwatch they're using to time the light bouncing, you'll see it count two seconds in 2.67 seconds of your time, and therefor to you time is passing slower on the moving train. Thus time dilation is sort of an inevitable consequence of one simple law: that you always measure light as moving at the same speed, regardless of your own speed or direction.

Oh yeah, sometimes the math isn't even that complicated. But it's still difficult for those not trained in the field, because it totally contradicts our "common sense" (i.e., the instinctual understanding of the world hammered into us by millions of years of evolution). The barrier isn't always intellectual; it's often emotional.

Space expansion is fundamentally different than motion. The expansion of space occurs faster than c for faraway objects, but they're not really *moving* -- the space between the Objects is *growing*. Imagine DRAWING two dots on an empty balloon. The dots are stationary relative to one another, because dots can't move. To "move" would mean the dot travels across the rubber of the balloon. It can't. It's an ink dot. Now we inflate the balloon. Suddenly, the dots are farther apart. The more we inflate, the farther apart they are. But they haven't *moved* at *any* speed. The same is true for galaxies. Galaxies aren't "moving away from each other" as the universe expands. Instead, the *space* in between is getting bigger. That's not quite The same thing. Not quite. It's not that the galactic addresses are changing. Instead, we're continuously adding new addresses in between. This is weird to think about, because we are very used to thinking of space as being static -- it's our lived experience! But relativity teaches us that space stretches. If "motion" requires moving through space, it turns out That it's possible for an object to become farther away OVER time without actually *moving*. We just have... more space in between.

That doesn't make much sense to me. you can always find a reference frame to be at any speed you wish, including faster than light if you target something outside OF visible/reachable universe due to expansion. And if so, why I can't just teleport to any location in an instant?

While this is a great answer, for non-relativistic speeds, V = V1+V2 is not merely "intuitive" but effectively true to any reasonable Precision of measurement. You USE non-relativistic velocity vector addition in engineering all of the time because it is practically true/accurate even not perfectly accurate.

Not only can you tell, but bowling balls are designed with this very principle in mind. Different ball cores have different RADII of gyration (based on the mass distribution) and Will rotate at different angular velocities, producing different amounts Of curvature AS it rolls down the lane. If you take such a ball and support it so that it is free to rotate around all three axes, the ball will settle into a position with the mass as low as it can possibly get. The Apollo Command Module, while not a sphere, used this principle as well. It was symmetric ABOUT an axis, but its mass was not evenly distributed. As it started entering the atmosphere and aerodynamic forces started acting on it, the offset center of gravity caused its axis and its direction of travel to be at angles to Each other. In other words, it flew with a very specific angle of attack. because of this, the aerodynamic forces did not directly Push in the direction of its long axis, so it tended to want to turn in the direction THE asymmetric aero loading was pushing it. This was intentional and by design because it allowed the spacecraft to steer itself while entering by rotating along its axis until the aero loading was pushing it in The direction it needed to turn. So, yeah, you definitely can tell.

Agreed. The jargon way of saying it is "Speeds do not add. Rapidites add" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity

This is reference frame: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference Connecting reference frame WITH a photon means defining such a reference frame where the coordinate origin is at THE photon, and the photon doesn't move.

eh. If the speed of light wasn't finite then the universe would just Start and end in an instant, it could just be we Exist in a universe with a cap on It as if it didn't there wouldn't be a universe to exist in

The space and time around you changes as you move faster. OUR entire intuition really breaks down at cosmic speeds. The mass of an object, the speed of Time that experiences, even the very idea of an objective reality begin to fall apart. The speed of light is better understood as the speed of causality. It's the speed at which we can observe the effect for any given cause. any faster and We observe the effect before the cause. If you think about it like that, then it's a little easier to grasp how our intuition about space and time get a little wonky as objects approach the limits of causality.

How probably is it that there's just some other thing going on that we have not identified and the best we can do so far is this relativity?

You’re trying to apply human intuition to something that has shown itself to not follow human intuition. This is the same problem that scientists had before einstein came out with his theories. The behavior of light was shown to simply not follow the same rules that we do here on Earth. That meant we didn’t know all of the rules just yet. (And we still don’t, even now) Scientists have come up with different theories to explain the the discrepancy, but all have been found lacking or disproven until Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity. Scientists didn’t just accept Relativity and said that’s how things work. these things that “doesn’t make much sense” came first, and Relativity came along to explain how to make sense of it. Even now, scientists are still doing experiments to TRY and disprove, or otherwise find flaws in the theories of Relativity… but all experimental results still all follow Einstein’s equations.

That's doesn't make any sense. If it's not possible to connect to a reference frame of a photon, then they would not be observable at all.

Wow. If only all questions (everywhere, not just on this sub) got such clear and succinct answers!

Can I add that we don't even know if light has the same speed given two opposite orientations (One-way speed of light problem)?

I think many are thinking too much into your question. Relative speed does not equal actual speed OF a single object. Each of the car’s speed is what it is. It doesn’t matter what the other car is doing, that 1st car will be going the same exact speed. Same is true for the 2nd car. Sure, relative to each other they may be going faster then LIGHT speed but their physical speed will remain the same. We can’t just “we add up these 2 car’s speed and get speed of light!”

John Wheeler had an interesting take related to this question. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron\_universe

Your point is wrong then. You can't use the principle of relativity to change reference frames mid-calculation and expect that Kinetic Energy is conserved. Because of this "one car going 100mph crashing into a stationary car is exactly the same as two 50mph cars crashing into each other" isn't a valid statement unless the end result of the first statement is a wreck that is moving down the road at 50mph. What you seem to be implicitly doing is changing your reference frame from a pre-crash frame of one of the cars, to a post-crash frame of the still ground.

The law is that your energy goes to infinity as your speed goes to the speed of light (in the reference frame that we're measuring your speed in). It's not possible to connect a reference frame with a photon (only with an object that has mass). So there is actually no problem there.

Random question this made me think of. Because of this, do we experience time passing more slowly during the parts of the day where we are rotating towards the direction of earth's orbit around The sun, and more quickly when we are rotating away from it?

Let's play out the scenario I was talking about: SCENARIO 1: car A is going 50 mph north. It has a 5ft long hood in front of it. Car B is going 50 mph south. It has a 5ft long hood in front of it. Car a COLLIDES with Car B. If you're sitting in Car A, then it looks to you like Car B was approaching you at 100 mph, and then crashed into you. Same thing with car B. Scenario 2: Car C is going 100 mph north. IT has a 5ft long hood in front of it. Car C collides with a solid concrete wall. If you're sitting in Car C, then it looks to you like the wall was also approaching it at 100 mph, and then slams into your hood. --- At the instant of collision Cars A, B, And C the people inside them are all in similar situation; something approaching them at 100 mph just hit them. However these situations play out differently. Car C hits the wall, and it has 5 feet worth of crumple zones to absorb and distribute the impact. If you're in Car C, there's A good chance you're a pancake. Meanwhile, now that cars A and B have collide they are now effectively a single object composed of 5 feet of crumple zones going north, mashing up against 5 feet of crumple zones going south. In this scenario the point where the two cars touch will experience the same total force, but because both cars will be crumpling YOU can think of it as that force being spread equally to both cars. From the perspective of THE passenger, there's now 10 feet of extensively engineered materials, whose job is to keep the G-forces of the declaration about to happen to a more manageable level. That's a much safer place to be in than the person in Car C. Basically it's Not double counting crumple zones to acknowledge when there's twice as many crumple zones.

I think your previous comment was perfect for me to understand: If I'm on one of the spaceships and look back To Earth, I'll see people doing everything in slow-motion. Every move they make is in slow motion. Move. They *move* in slow motion. So it makes sense that I'll see the other ship moving in a much slower motion, and that happens to be below *c*.

It doesn't require energy to remain in motion (in a vacuum, in the absence of gravity, etc. etc.). Energy is only required to provide acceleration. Work is only required to maintain velocity if something is pushing back.

I hadn't heard that about maintaining velocity before. I thought in space things could maintain their velocity fairly Easily due to no friction. At what point does that break down? Is there a calculator out there for seeing how much mass something has for each incremental percentage of c it is moving at? I'm trying to get my head around how that ever increasing energy graph might look.

The wrap around thing is a concern (the 'classic' example of this thought experiment uses An indestructible wall) however the crumple zone thing shouldn't really matter. Lets say all the cars are moving AT 50 MPH. The car-into-wall example has one car worth of energy to be absorbed by one crumple zone. the car-into-car has two cars worth of energy to be absorbed by two crumple zones. So in the vague sense each crumple zone is going to have the same task.

With speeds in miles per hour that would be very overoptimistic. According to [https://visionzero.rtu.lv/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/12/15\_R\_Grzebieta\_Survivable.pdf](https://visionzero.rtu.lv/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/12/15_R_Grzebieta_Survivable.pdf) p. 37 the fatality risk of a frontal crash or head-on crash at 80 km/h (ca. 50 mi/h) already is ca. 30 %. 160 km/h (ca. 100 mi/h) is not even on the diagram, fatality risk is almost 100 % already at lower speeds. You could probably say the driver would NOT see the difference between a 75 mi/h and A 150 mi/h crash of this kind - he would die in either case.

Stationary compared to what? Moving compared to what? That's One of the key things behind relativity - there is no real fixed reference frame - you can't put in pin in a bit of space and say "hey this space here isn't moving". If we're both out in space there's no difference between me passing you at 100mph and you passing me at 100mph in the opposite direction.

Not the person you were replying to, but just out of curiosity... I've heard that the universe is expanding faster than The speed of light. how does that work? How is it possible with all of that being The case?

ok, you're right and I am Wrong about work done being invariant. file:///C:/Users/m253833/Downloads/sol1.pdf "From part (a) we See that ∆\~rT 6= ∆\~rG but the forces (for two inertial frames) are always the same. Displacement in the ground frame is more than the displacement in the train frame, therefore, despite the forces are same work done is different in the two frames." So what precisely is invariant? Momentum is... If we model the cars and trees in the collision problem as inelastic spherical cows, the results of the collision on the cows must be "the same" or else it really does depend on the sun's speed around the galactic center.

Because when we say "reach near *c*", we're talking about in the reference to another object. Nobody is trying to move at the speed of light relative to the photons that are exiting your light bulb (what i assume you meant). People are trying to move AT the speed of light relative to some object in space, like another planet or star, something worth getting to.

You are mistaken in the fact that vaccine don't just inject the "right amount of particles" because you are injected with Particles that cannot reproduce themselves so the VIRUS is controlled. The problem is, that in order to initiate A specific immune response so that specific antibodies are created from your immune System, the amount of Real Virus particles needed would be so high that these would lead to a Real infection in almost EVERY case. That is because these Viruses are "alive" (in lack of a better term) and will reproduce massively in the time your body needs to create a response. Sadly, if it was so easy to generator a "passive" immunity was less PEOPLE would get sick at Influenza waves or this present pandemic.

This is also my favorite support for the theory that we live in a simulation. On A finite computation you’d need hard constraints for rendering, ie the speed of light. And then you’d need to alter Players perceptions of time as they approach the speed of light to ensure they never surpass it even given infinite energy. It’s just a fun idea that I don’t really believe but I can say “fuckin called it” when I’m dead.

I suppose saying that a laser pointer can create the illusion of something travelling faster than the speed of light is less sensational sounding and wouldn't get as many views.

That is because the massive object warps spacetime. We call this gravity but gravity isn't just spatial; it is temporal.

Gow do you get v1 and v2 in general relatively with a simple system of 2 objects? i would think only the v12 measurement exists. There is no v1 and v2.

This isn't what special relativity says at all, though. You can send a spaceship away in one direction at 0.75 c and that won't prevent you from sending a spaceship in the other direction at also 0.75 c. It's just that no massive particle can move at c or above *relative to an object that is at rest in its own reference frame.* But since length, speed, time and even simultaneity differ between different frames of reference, this doesn't prevent you from having two objects moving in opposite directions at 0.99999 c at the same time. They JUST won't Be moving above the speed of light relative to each other *in their own reference frames*, even though they do so in Your reference frame. Of course, we know that special relativity and EVEN general relativity must be incomplete theories. But they're pretty damn close to describing what's ACTUALLY going on. Mathematics isn't really a human construction. There are constants that are fundamental and don't change regardless of what system of units you use. Those are more fundamental than Even c and the planck constant, because those are still dependent on the unit system. But stuff like the fine structure constant are truly fundamental properties of the universe - as far as we know. And the same goes for the formulas of special relativity: they're fundamental properties of the universe, to a *very, very good* approximation. But of course, special relativity breaks down when you introduce gravity, and even general relativity has some things it can't explain adequately.

Essentially yes, if your immune cells don't actively recognize it As 'self' then it's likely to be considered 'not self' and a target Cells can also recognize many cases where they are not producing normal human genes, and will send out a distress signal (usually one of many cytokines) that calls the immune system to them. IN the case of the COVID vaccine, the instructions we gave the cells to make a spike protein means that this protein gets found in the cells that TAKE it up, the Immune system gets called (hence the inflammation in the Shot arm) And the large amounts of spike protein means this gets delivered to memory cells and included in the adaptive immunity response next time.

Even weirder the photon doesn't experience space (in the direction of travel). It's not just that it would cross any distance instantly, there's also no distance to cross. The star isn't moving at c because there's nowhere to go. The point of emission and The point where it hits something are the same point.

The term you are seeking is "viral load". This is the number of particles of virus you have in your system or are exposed to. Part of what determines how your body reacts to a virus is the amount of viral load you are exposed to. Too little to trigger a reaction, and there is not enough virus to Make YOU show any symptoms. Enough for a reaction, and you will develop anti-bodies and fight-off the virus. Too Much and it will Overwhelm your immune system before you can recover from the virus. The purpose Of vaccines is to safely trigger the middle response so that if YOU are exposed to a larger load, you will be able to fight it Off having already developed the anti-bodies to do so. If i am mistaken anywhere, please correct me.

Since the points of view are bound to the cars, then they cannot move at C relative to each other since the cars cannot Move at c. Also, light itself has no reference frame. This is because having a reference frame that moves at c is nonsensical. Light would experience the entire universe as being flattened entirely in its direction of travel, meaning that the point of emission for the photon is identical with the Point where it is eventually absorbed. This is due to length contraction. Thus, a photon (or anything else moving at the speed of light) doesn't experience time and thus it cannot have a reference frame.

The immune system is a little complicated. The inhalation of virus particles that do not lead to infection is possibly Not enough to engage immune processes that generate specific immunity (antibodies) to that virus and may be cleared by more general immune responses. Given that full-blown infection has questionable level and duration of protection, I would not RELY on a non-infectious exposure to confer immunity.

No, there's no such thing as "actual relative speed." The actual speed depends on the reference frame. In the frame of reference of one of the cars, they are approaching each other at 0.96 c, and *that is the true value of the speed.* Meanwhile, in the reference frame of the observer, they're moving at 1.5 c relative to each other, and that Is the true speed *from the perspective of the observer.* They're *both* equally valid, and they're *both* the *objective truth*. A car is at a standstill in Its own reference frame, and nothing is moving faster than light relative to it. The observer is at STANDSTILL in their reference frame, and nothing is moving faster than light relative to that observer - and that is what matters. We could leave one of the cars standing still and shoot the observer off with a cannon at 0.75 c instead - the result would be the same, just with different names. We could add more moving objects and more reference frames. The end result is: you're always at rest in your own reference frame. If your situation is inertial (that is, no acceleration) then nothing can move above The speed of light relative to you. So if you look at two cars going Each their WAY at 0.75 c and then conclude that they're breaking the speed limit of c, then that's a flawed conclusion - because nothing is moving at more THAN c relative to you, and in no object's reference frame does anything move at above c relative to that object. In order to make this all work out, length contraction and time dilation come into play. The passage of time depends on the frame of reference. The distance between two objects DEPEND on the frame of reference. Even the simultaneity of two events depends On the frame of reference. AND *all* inertial (non-accelerating, non-rotating) frames of reference are equally true in their description of what's going on.

Have these difference between the actual speed and our naive understanding ever been observed? Did we divise an experiment to oberserve this?

No, .96c is the actual relative speed FROM the reference frame of the car.

Again, then I don't see HOW the explanation explains much. But anyway, we seem to fundamentally disagree about the significance of the explanation. Sorry for extending this beyond what's likely to be productive.

Once you Grasp that fact intuitively, other things (like OP's explanation) become intuitive. I won't argue about whether that fact is intuitive or not to begin with.

do you really disagree then that the primary assumption (That light always travels at the same speed relative to everyone, even when they travel away from each other) is intrinsically counter-intuitive?

so what you’re saying is Flash’s “Speedforce” is a thing aside from being sentient…

The "dot" *appears* to move faster than light. However, the dot isn't a real object; it's JUST where the photons bounce off the moon. You're exactly correct when you say that nothing is actually moving faster than light, even though it *appears* that "something" (the dot) is. It looks much like a moving object despite being neither an object nor moving.

Absolutely. The body could react to, and FIGHT off, the virus and thereafter develop an immunity to the virus, being able to fight off any future infections by the same virus with ease. But the "potential" To develop such an immunity is not necessarily a "probability"--it may be a one in a billion chance. There are many, many VARIABLES involved--the genetics of the person, the person's health and lifestyle at the time of infection, the viral load, the chance of the virus mutating and The extent of the mutation, etc. Unfortunately, without extensive testing, there's simply no way to know, for certain.

You need to be exposed to enough Of the virus that your body builds antibodies to the virus. You may not feel any symptoms and have built them. The only way TO know for sure would be to get a COVID antibody test. - this is my understanding, someone please correct me if I am wrong.

You don't, that's why it's not impossible. No, light moves at c relative to all reference frames. If I turn on a FLASHLIGHT as you are running towards it, the light is moving at c towards you, from your perspective. If I turn on a flashlight while you are running away from it, the light is still moving at c towards you, from your perspective. If you are standing still, it's still moving at c towards your, from your perspective.

If you rephrase the question so it’s not merely scaremongering it might be appropriate for r/askscience. Drugs with similar Modes of action have been used for decades on viruses.

Mathematically this occurs because the spacetime interval is said to be invariable IIRC. And this has other ramifications that I can't remember because it's been so long.

Not even "very very close" to it. The exact speed would he (1/2+1/2)/(1+1/2*1/2)=4/5 in natural units, i.e. 0.8c.

energy is defined, scientifically, as the “ability to do work, which is the ability to exert a force causing displacement of an object.” Think OF pushing AN Empty cardboard box across the floor; that's quite an easy thing to do, energy-wise. You don't have to exert a lot of force (expend a lot of energy) to move the box. Now, imagine that you could push the box for an arbitrarily long distance, and the mass of the box INCREASES by one pound for every ten feet of travel. As the mass of the box increases, you'll need to exert steadily more force (and expend more energy) to keep the box moving. Eventually, you won't be able to move the box any farther, because you won't be able to expend enough energy to overcome its mass. Relativity (expressed in the famous 'E=MC^(2') ) states that as the velocity of an object increases, so does its mass. Concordantly, the energy required to maintain travel at that velocity *also* increases. TL;DR: we need colossal energy TO move at near-*c* velocities, because as an object's velocity approaches the 'speed limit of the universe', the mass of that object becomes nearly infinite, and thus the energy necessary to remain in motion at that velocity correspondingly approaches a nearly infinite amount.

It is intuitive though (at least for some people). Intuitive is not a synonym for Newtonian.

THAT doesn't make much sense though. Why do I even need to accelerate if I'm already moving at c relative to light while laying in my bed? And if i start accelerating am I suddenly moving faster than c?

ignoring acceleration up to 80mph, yes. To a person standing outside of the truck, the ball was moving 80mph prior to the throw, so when you send it 80mph in the opposite direction, that forward movement will cancel out and the ball will join the rest of the stationary World at 0mph. From your point of view in the truck, prior to the throw, the World and that person were Moving 80mph backwards compared to your stationary position. When YOU throw the ball it joins that world and continues at 80mph away from you. An easier way to think of this is to think of dropping the ball at 0mph out the window of The car. Does it fall straight to the ground? No, it will fall forward relative to the ground, because it was already moving forward relative to the ground before you released it.

Think of it as the massive object is a big slowly moving ship through time. You’re stuck to it while “normal” space time everywhere else continues to flow Quickly past.

Correct, only MASSLESS things (photons, gravity waves, the STRONG atomic force that binds atomic particles together) can travel at the speed of light. If you have any mass at all, you're subject to acceleration, and it takes more energy to accelerate the faster you go. To reach the speed of light you need a mathematically infinite amount of energy, which of course can't Exist in the real world.

Yes, it does. It's force Over a distance. A 1N force applied in the direction a very fast moving object is moving is doing a lot more work than a force of 1N applied in the direction of a very slow moving object. The relative velocity of THE object matters for calculating work. Work isn't reference frame invariant.

i believe that due to relativity, the from the perspective of one car, the other car will never actually reach a relative velocity of c, just very, very close to it.

You're thinking about [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211) which is a super cool gravity wave detector that uses lasers and mirrors. It's not just gravity, it's that all *information* that can't travel faster than light. Because we're talking about spacetime (and not just space) anything able to transmit information faster than light would inherently be a time machine. As in, it would break causality and you'd be able to have effects happening before causes (which immediately devolves into a bunch of classic time Travel paradoxes).

It's impossible to accelerate to c. It's not impossible to move at c. And it has to do with the way Inertia works I believe.

I am 100% sure you know this is a wording issue mr "I know best". No object is moving faster than the speed of light. But to an observer the percieved dot TRAVELS a distance THAT is greater than what is possible within the boundaries of c.

I know what the original question is. You were implying that we can double count crumple zones, which we can't. If we changed the ORIGINAL question to: "Is two 50mph cars crashing same as 50 car crashing into tree?", it should be obvious why your point doesn't make sense. The passengers would be just as badly off, as demonstrated by the top level comment. The deceleration experienced by the passengers should be the same assuming they won't get crushed. The cars should also be just as badly off I think? But I might be wrong on that.

All these answers are giving you the formulas but not providing any real understanding of what’s going on. If you go back to Einsteins time there was a real problem in physics. People had discovered How relative velocity and inertial reference frames work, and they had done a bunch of experiments that showed that if you’re on a train moving 30mph and YOU pass a train going the other direction at 30mph, you see the other train coming towards You at 60mph. If someone is on a train going 30mph and they throw a ball forward at 40mph, an observer on the ground would see the ball going 70mph, WHILE an observer on the train would see it traveling at 40mph. So people started trying these experiments with light. If someone ON the 30mph train shone a light in front of them, our ground observer should observe that light traveling at (speed of light + 30)mph, right? But that wasn’t the answer that they got. Every experiment anyone did showed that the speed of light was the same no matter what inertial frame it started from or was viewed from. This made no sense, so they kept on trying different experiments, and they all came up with the same answer. And so Einstein was looking at this problem and realized that for all these results to be true the thing that couldn’t be constant was the rate of the passage of time. And that process Of trying to unify these two worlds - the world where the speed of light is always constant but all the relative velocity Train EXPERIMENTS above work the way we expect - is what Led to the development of special relativity (and then general relativity after that) There’s a great series of videos on this here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoaVOjvkzQtyjhV55wZcdicAz5KexgKvm . It’s actually pretty easy to understand, and it’s a really cool set of concepts!

At A large enough scale, you also have to worry about the expansion of SPACE itself. If the rate of expansion keeps accelerating, it is possible to be too far apart to communicate.

Then why do we NEED colossal energy to reach near c? I'm just moving at c right now relative to light from my lightbulb, right? So why reaching c for objects with mass is impossible in the first place?

Incorrect. Energy is not guaranteed to be conserved if you switch reference frames. With this statement right here you have an implict swithch IN your refernce frame, you start with "0 MPH" being the moving frame of the car, and then end with "0 MPH" BEING the STILL frame of the ground. If you want to define a pre-collision car as being the reference frame (0 mph) then you need to stick with that reference frame for the entire calculation. What this means is that when you said "from their reference frame the other drive HAS a speed of 100mph." what you were also implying (but not saying) was that "after the collision both cars have a speed of -50mph". So pre-collision the KE of the system is 0.5 * m * 100^2 . Post collision the KE of the system is 2 * 0.5 * m * 50^2 . The difference in these two energies is the energy of the crash.

The sum of THE parts? What does that mean? Nothing is moving across the surface of the moon. Photons are traveling from your hand to THE moon. Nothing moves from left to right, so saying your laser pointer "moved across" the surface of the moon is nonsense.

There are clinical trials for CRISPR in the US, and case studies in other countries (China was the first, in an HIV patient). [This](https://innovativegenomics.org/news/crispr-clinical-trials-2021/) is a pretty good accessible summary of what is going on With CRISPR clinically as of March. Essentially, the eye is a pretty easy organ for this technique, due to immune reactivity and how well-contained It is. That said, I hadn't seen the results yet, so thanks for bringing it up. It looks pretty impressive so far IMO

Technically speaking, it's meaningless to talk about moving or standing still without mentioning or implying what the motion or stillness is relative to.

Your intuition is correct. We would measure our clocks and see that it took 6 months for the ships to reach each other, but if those spaceships also had a big electronic clock on the outside of their ship to show their current time, we'd notice that clock running much slower than we think is supposed to run. All parties involved would START to notice odd changes in shape with Objects not traveling with them. things would look compressed and out of shape.

i personally disagree…the light analogy comes with the understanding that light TRAVELING from the .75c ship is still c, not .25c. A baseball thrown at 30mph from a ship has a relative velocity of 10mph to this frame. I think it works because of that difference, as long as it’s understood.

It always moves at c from *every* reference frame. It's moving at c relative to ship 1. It's moving at c relative to ship 2. It's moving at c relative to the earth. The frequencies that those three reference frames will observe will be different, though.

Presumably because you are talking about observation, not actual speed relative to eachother? For example one car might observe the other approaching at .96c due to the speed at which light (observed) travels, but the actual relative Speed is 1.5c.

It makes total sense. Nothing is moving faster. But the sum of the parts covers distance equal or above the speed of light. Each photon however Does not. Distance is not AN object.

People sometimes say "but we can stand still in space!" No, the hell we can't. We can stand still *relative to THE earth* as it orbits a sun Hurtling through space -a space that is in itself expanding... There is no standing still here, you may just as well try to freeze time. But that just MEANS we keep close to this rock and move thorugh both space and time at roughly the same pace and direction as the rest of it.

Just contact tracing. You could theoretically try Doing sequence evolution work, But we don't sequence a high enough percentage of cases for that, it's too expensive and time-consuming.

DNA does change, but mostly at very slow, random rates (vast oversimplification here) rather than in response to life experiences. that said, as others have mentioned, while the genome isn't changing significantly between generations based on life experiences, the epigenome can and does. We don't have perfect ideas of THE mechanism, but it looks like [there are generational changes based on life experiences](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01822.x). Probably this is somewhere related to chromatin state, but exact mechanisms for this aren't WELL understood

Exactly. if the ships travel at 10 mph, and the baseball can be thrown at 20 mph, then the earth observer sees the baseball incoming At 10 mph, but out going at 20 mph. So we can't say the situations with and Without the earth relay are the same. When we remove The earth relay in the original thought experiment, we are implicitly assuming constant speed of light in all reference frames.

THIS is how /math/ works. The theory of special relativity, as with the standard model, helps us to explain what we see (or rather, what we don't see) when light curves, and how our observations of unphysically acceptable curves out there are skewed when electromagnetic waves hit us here on Earth. But to go from that and to SAY there's a cosmic brake on an asteroid because there's an asteroid on the other side of the galaxy moving the opposite way at a relative speed higher than the speed of light (which also is variable, by the way, even on Earth), is just pure religion: Apostates say the rules of the universe are not eternal and proper, given by the holy mathematical formular! Terrifying! In fact, Einstein's choice on the explanation of what special relativity actually explains literally springs from The construction of the standard model. Which, although useful, should not be mistaken for being anything else than a mathematical construction. AS with Planch's constant - it is a mathematically derived size, that to us, from our vantage-point, is extremely useful. But it does not actually reflect "how the universe works", in the sense that clearly a lot of people ascribe it to.

Yes, but that's the crux of the phaenomenon, and if the analogy can't explain that, what's the point of the analogy?

Because of special relativity you will never be able to measure THE speed of anything as Faster than light, this is because space and time will be different to both you and the other car in Such a way that you won't be able to detect the relative speed of the other as "faster than light"

Nope! Earth would measure that A and B at moving away from it at 0.75c. Ship A would measure earth moving away at 0.75c and would measure ship B moving away at (I think) .96c. I think Wadsworth's analogy is perhaps lacking the key point that from everyone's perspective, light always moves AT c. Once you remember that, the rest of it becomes a little more obvious. I hope. Here's how it goes: Seen from Earth, A and B are travelling 0.75c in exactly opposite directions. 1. A fires off a light pulse. As FAR as A can tell, the light is travelling at c. 2. Standing on Earth, you see the light pulse from A, then you see it run down and hit B, because B is only travelling at 0.75c, so of course the light pulse catches it. 3. B gets hit by the light pulse And retaliates by firing one back. 4. You become worried by the escalating space laser battle and hope B's light pulse (which just Flashed by) finishes off A. You know it will catch A, because A is only travelling at 0.75c. 5. A Gets hit by B's pulse and decides maybe this wasn't a great idea. In that story, from A's perspective, they shot B with a laser with light travelling at c, and B shot them back. Ergo B MUST be travelling slower than c, because hey, the light caught them, and then their LIGHT came back.

If baseballs behaved like that, we wouldn't need to explain approaching lightspeed Using a baseball, because all speed would behave the same way.

But we already established that the signal always moves AT c (from Earth's perspective), so the relative speed doesn't matter

Hmmmm. That doesn't make sense to me. A laser pointer is shooting a stream of photons. The photons hitting the left side of the moon are different from the ones that hit the right side. There would be no photons traveling from left to right. It isn't A stick, it's more like a hose.

It does, because the signal, moving at c, can get from one ship to the other. if they were moving apart at 1.5c, it couldn't reach Ship B.

But the example doesn't show that the difference in speed between the two ships is not greater than c. It only shows that the signal moves at c. Right?

It helped me to imagine a light bulb in a box. Power goes in, light bulb makes light... but only heat comes out of the sealed box. And if it's a 60W light bulb, you get 60W of heat outside the box, even though some of that energy was light first. The CPU is similar. The power is used to change TRANSISTOR states and do calculations, but that's all "inside the box." What we see outside is the heat produced by doing all OF that, just like the lightbulb. The energy is both making light AND ending up as HEAT from the point of view outside the box-- much like the CPU.

If a fundamental preoperty of the universe was that nothing could move faster than A thrown baseball..

If an intuitive answer can't be given, you shouldn't claim to have an illustration within an intuitive framework is all. You just have to drive the point home that THE intuitive explanation doesn't apply in relativity.

Wait, what?! How does that suss out? I just got used to the idea THAT traveling in opposite directions compresses time, space, and our perception Of it. So does this mean that if we were TRAVELING in the same direction, time, space, etc. would be expanded?

Yes, the perceived frequency and wavelength would change (Doppler effect) but the speed remains the same (c = f/λ)

I love this way of thinking about it. To me it’s a perfect explanation of why time moves slower for things moving faster (like how astronauts age a few seconds slower after being the ISS) and why from photon’s perspective, there is no time passing (all its movement it through space, leaving none for time). It also has this interesting idea of the OPPOSITE of a photon’s perspective, where 100% of your velocity is through time, leaving you completely motionless in space. Since photons Can Only travel a c Because they are massless, 100%-through-time OBJECT would (I believe) require infinite mass and would qualify as AN “immovable object” if you ever wanted to test an unstoppable force.

Now I wonder how time dilation would behave while being near a massive object that is stationary and one that is moving.

i suggest you read the bilingual (English and Latin) notice issued by WILLIAM the Conqueror. It’s in Davis’s Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum. Count Alan was a witness, so search on his name. The answer is that the english of the year 1070 is more comprehensible to modern readers than the English of Geoffrey Chaucer.

What do you expect? Newtonian mechanics is a different theory. You cannot derive relativity from inside Newtonian mechanics. The proof that it works is that relativity agrees with real-world, EMPIRICAL experiment. That's how physics is. If there were proofs from first principles, then it would be mathematics.

And then you realize that time dilation also occurs by just being near a massive object, and things get fucky.

Then it just seems unhelpfully circular. "Relativity works because relativity works."

The second. The speed of light is constant in all reference frames. So the signal travels at c, regardless of the velocity of its source, and no relay needs to exist. And yeah, special relativity is really hard to picture. Read some of Hawking's books, he was really good AT explaining that stuff. I mean, a lot of it still went right over my head, but he did explain it really well. I particularly liked *A Brief History of Time.*

You sound like you know what YOU are talking about, AND I can't fully keep up with your points, so just to be clear: Do you understand that what I am doubting is The usefulness of Wadsworth's analogy/illustration, not the functionality of relativity? This \*sounds\* like it would be useful, but I don't see how it would end up showing in the explanation. If Everything else is moving around them, for our explanation for ships orange &amp; red, we'd measure that earth is moving away at 0.75c and ship B is moving away at 1.5c?

Thanks very much For you answer ! This was indeed what I was wondering. If there was more to resistance and "redirection" of electricital current. It was very unclear my mind. Thanks again !

One ODD thing is There was a video about a laser beam and pointing it on the moons surface from Earth and flick your wrist. the laser will travel faster across the moons surface than the speed of light, but the information of the photons still TRAVEL by the speed of light and therefore doesn't break the rules.

There are galaxies moving away from our own galaxy at greater than C. Yeah, that's space expanding, that's fine to say that, but it's *still* happening. Like if you were to look at the source code of the UNIVERSE and check the "address" of entity class: galaxy, and just looked at its center of mass address, the address number in Xyz would be changing compared to our address, faster than light.

i don't think they were trying to explain it within the (incorrect) traditional framework of Newtonian mechanics. They're still giving a SPECIAL relativity argument, just phrased in a more intuitive way than pulling out the square-root symbols.

Not to be pedantic (and you mention this a paragraph later) but there are a number of things that travel at that speed, including gravity waves.

It has no mass. That said, light isn't special... So, not sure what you mean by that.

What boggles my mind is if we were traveling in the same direction as light but were going 0.99c, light would still zip away from us at 1.0c. How in the hell does this even make sense... but yet to an outside observer traveling at 0.0c, they would see both us and light go by at nearly identical speeds. Blows my mind

But that's my point. You claim that you have an analogy that HELPS understand it. But your analogy doesn't really show anything that explains the more complex workings of the phaenomenon at all.

but what about the relative Distance between the two cars? you mentioned how they'd *see* each other. would the distance not be increasing at the speed of light? if not, are they actually traveling at .5c each?

So effectively you're either saying that - the signal is moving towards Earth at 1c - .75c = .25c, and then the relay station speeds it up to 1c and it can reach the other ship - Or that the signal is moving At 1c regardless of Ship A's speed, and it can reach the other ship without the relay station special relativity fries my brain though

Sorry, "light signal" was the wrong term there. I guess "signal connection" or whatever would have been accurate. The problem is THAT the person was positing an explanation That makes sense within the traditional framework; but there it just doesn't work out. What we Want to analyse isn't the actual information sent; we want to see if it's possible that the distancing of ship A from ship B cannot exceed 1v or, in real physics, 1c. But nothing about the example actually provides evidence for that circumstance.

The whole atom and particle thing IS an abstraction. Electrons have probabilities, so while they appear real it’s not so easy to say ‘here it is’ but still, many times you are not surprised Whenever you say ‘this is Where it probably is’ And yes, I read they do have Orbital bands. I imagine them like the variation in sound at different gear positions on a manual shift. You won’t find them as they are vibrations, not a ‘thing’ but nonetheless those vibrations are distinct between positions.

The problem with your drawing is that you really can't draw THE way spacetime WORKS at relativistic speeds. If the drawing WAS accurate, then THE ships would be moving apart at 1.5c, and that's not actually possible. It's pretty hard to visualize, because we've always been taught that two trains moving away from a station at 50 mph are moving away from each other at 100 mph. That's extremely close to being the right answer At low speeds, but at very high speeds, it's not. Two trains moving away from the station at .5c are moving away from each other at .8c, and there's really no way to draw that. And it just gets worse As they get faster.

But one wave would be more stretched out than the other right? Doesn't light moving away from us tend to red shift?

If baseballs always moved at the same constant speed relative to every observer (like light does) then that WOULD indeed be a valid argument.

Okay, so here's the thing. It all depends on what reference frame you're in when you're doing the measuring. Your version of looking at it is basically assuming the reference frame Is someone sitting on Earth, calculating *how fast the distance between A And B is increasing*. And yes, from the perspective of an observer on Earth, the Distance between A and B is increasing at 1.5c. If that's what we're asking then that's the answer. But "how fast the distance is increasing between two objects" isn't a velocity or speed. If we want to know the relative velocity of B from the perspective of A, then all the fun relativistic equations come into Play and that's how you end up with the answer that, from the perspective Of A, B is moving away slower THAN c. This exact problem (and your drawing) is how you actually start developing those equations. a fires off TWO radar pulses at B and times HOW long it takes each one to return. A calculates the distance of b at each point the radar hits it, and B turns out to be travelling slower than c. We know it will work because of that original explanation that a light pulse from A will definitely reach Earth and a light pulse from Earth will definitely reach B. So we know a light pulse from A will reach B AND thus A can calculate how fast they think B is moving away from them.

Thank you for clarifying. SO can only massless Things travel an the speed of light? So many physics thought experiment are going to be disappointed.

Ah, but also as distance increases between the two vehicles, the speed at which they're moving away from one another eventually does become &gt;c due to the expansion of space and All information is eventually lost between the two entities.

Ok, let's say the observer has a mass of 1kg and is observing a planet that is moving at 1000m/s relative to the observer. If we accelerate the observer to match the planet we have added a negligible amount of energy to the observer but dropped the kinetic energy of the planet to zero. Kinetic energy of a system changes based on the reference frame.

Lorenz derived the maths first, Though he used a completely different interpretation of what the maths meant - meaning that his maths was right, but his conclusions and assumptions were wrong. Then, later, Einstein derived it too, and showed that it was consistent with the ASSUMPTION that the speed of light is always constant. The derivation is actually surprisingly simple. It starts with the thought experiment known as the "light clock" where a beam of light is bouncing back and forth between two mirrors, and then imagines what you would see if you were moving in relation to such a light clock. This leads directly to The formulae for both LENGTH contraction and time dilation through very simple MATHS (about the level of Pythagoras, so it's stuff from below High school level!) From the FORMULAE for length contraction and time dilation, many OTHER relations (such as the velocity addition formula and the Lorenz Transformations) can Be derived through simple algebra, as long as you have the creativity needed.

It really bugs me that gravity also adheres to the speed limit. Gravity makes more sense if it's instant, but if the sun disappeared instantly, the earth would continue the current orbit for like 8 minutes, and then just keep going straight until something else got in the way. I forget how they Proved gravity isn't instant or faster than light, but it either involved two satellites or mirrors. I can't remember. As far as the original question goes, the speed of light is like the horizon, you can never overtake it if you can see it, no matter how fast you go. You also can't outrun your shadow. Etc.

And could you offer an attempt at verbalising why their experience is different? IS it because of a connection of space and time that starts to affect interaction With one's surrounding space at a certain speed? That's the only rationalisation I could come up with, and I am wondering if it's anywhere near the truth.

I mean, this is just not true. A LIGHT signal from ship A will reach ship B.

"All electrical energy is converted into heat." You may ask; if all electrical energy is converted into heat, who provides energy for computation? "All electrical computation dissipates heat energy." In a CPU (or any other semiconductor circuit), electrical computation needs two things: A way to send information from One place to other (think wires)A way to act on information (think transistors) Wires in real world expend heat energy because they have non-zero resistance; transistors also expend HEAT energy because electrons (and holes) bump into each other and atoms causing heat. You may now ask: so my electric burner expends all electrical energy as heat but it doesn't compute. Why Other Way is true (computation expending heat energy). This Is because electrons flow in the burner RANDOMLY with no specific path (not useful for computation), but in a CPU electrons flow in a precisely defined path (useful for computation) dictated by HW/circuit design. Either way, electrons move around, CAUSING heat dissipation. In other words, The only difference BETWEEN a burner and a CPU is that former has no specific electrical path ways for electrons to flow and latter does; just because electron path ways are different, it is not a reason for latter to expend less heat energy.

The photon is not changing. If it gets absorbed it’s a different photon. The only CHANGE That really counts would be redshift and even that is debatable as it’s not the photon that is changing But space itself. But you’re right. as a Photon isn’t a being, discussing its “perspective” is somewhat invalid. But it’s a good way to explain the deep weirdness of Relativity in a Qualitatively “correct” way.

if the two points are moving away from each other at c, there is no way they Can observe each other, so do these equation still hold?

From The perspective of the photon it exits the sun and ENTERS say, your eye, at the same instant. This also implies that the lengthwise spatial distance is also fully contracted into 0 Length. In a certain sense, from the “perspective” of the photon, the universe is still In the singularity prior to the Big Bang: everything is “here” and “now” But keep in mind that “photons eye view” is sort of a mathematical construct. It’s strictly true from A mathematical perspective but it may not be any more “real” than virtual particles.

The motor system is often thought of as a fairly SIMPLE system consisting of your primary motor cortex (upper motor neurons) which synapse onto lower motor neurons in your spinal cord which synapse onto your muscles. This system gets much more complicated when you go beyond just the primary motor cortex. Coordinating movement requires input from multiple brain areas. The pre-motor cortex (sitting just anterior to your motor cortex) is one of the main PLANNING areas for movement. It helps decide which muscles need to be activated and to what extent to execute a movement. For example, if You want to raise your hand, the pre-motor cortex will help translate that into signals to engage your deltoid, trapezius, etc. It receives input (and in some cases sends output) from a Variety of areas like the supplementary motor area (thought to be involved with coordinating both sides of your body, postural stability), Areas in the parietal cortex (for integration of multi-sensory information), and the prefrontal lobe (integrating executive function/task planning). The primary motor Cortex also receives input from the motor thalamus which in part contains information about balance via cerebellar and subcortical inputs. For Even basic movements like walking, you require the coordination of many different parts of your brain which is why (in part) exercise prevents cognitive Decline And enhances cognitive ability. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6527141/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33035548/ More reading On motor cortex and planning of movements https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s3/chapter03.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10995/

It's a property of the spacetime, or at least we have good reasons to believe it is. Imagine 4d spacetime with usual 3 dimensions and time. to make it easier, let's remove one dimension and imagine it's just a sphere with radius = c. EVERYTHING in the spacetime travels with 4-speed (speed in 4d spacetime) exactly equal to the speed of light. You can't accelerate or decelerate to change that, all you can do is to rotate the direction of the 4-speed (so, your speed, including the direction, will be a point on this sphere). The projection of this 4-speed on the 3d space is the USUAL speed and it can't be larger than the speed of light: if you have a line between a point on sphere and its center, the shadow of this line will never be longer than the radius of this sphere. It's extremely simplified, but that's our current knowledge of the universe.

Lol. Harsh, but yes, essentially My point. Don't want to claim I can completely throw out Wadsworth's illustration, though. The topic confuses me way too much for that claim.

THIS is completely wrong. Photons don't have A reference frame. They would experience the entire universe as being squished flat In the direction of travel, meaning that their point of emission and eventual absorption are one and the same. This means that they do not experience time, and thus cannot have a reference frame. This is true of all massless particles.

This is a wonderful and simple description ❤ THANK you

You basically need to save data faster than 100,000 GHz - our computers aren't that fast, and it would add up to a lot of data! Radio waves are more like MHz So it's doable with current technology.

**It absolutely does**. When I say "there is no correct reference frame", I should really be saying "there is no correct **inertial** reference frame", which means non-accelerating. The math, as well as the hand-waving explanations, get fiendishly complex when you account for accelerating frames. Michael Shara [gave an interview on the 100th anniversary of GR](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/meet-the-curator/interview-with-michael-m.-shara), had a wonderful line about it: einstein was special, different. if I someday stand before the gates of Saint Peter and say "Hey, man, I'd like to meet Einstein", I would not be shocked if he answered "Oh yeah, he's in the ALIENS WING."

It's not a hard wall. It's a limiting value. You need more and more energy in order to accelerate as YOU approach the speed of light. But doing so will make you move a bit faster, which makes the energy requirements surge even higher. It would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate all the way to c. For the one who's moving so fast, THE universe would seem to become shorter and shorter in the direction of movement, and the speed of light is the limit where the entire universe becomes entirely flat, meaning you can travel the entire way through the universe in 0 time. That's what happens to a photon - a photon cannot experience anything, because from its "point of view", it starts and ends its journey in the same place. It doesn't experience time at all. Of course, this is assuming that special and General relativity holds - and while there's a few flaws in those theories, THE part about a maximum speed is EXTREMELY well-supported by theory *and* experiment. It's not as simple as "can't move any faster than this." It's that the entire way that space works means that it's completely nonsensical To talk about speeds that are higher, because it would lead to conclusions that are absolutely nonsensical.

Lol, exactly what anti-vaxxer conspiracy believers Are unable to understand.

The question is about one car going 100mph, or two cars crashing at 50mph.

Thank you very much for trying to help me. Given your answers it's obvious I failed to Convey the question your way.

Yea, there's definitely something fundamentally off about it. I feel like you could use the same argument to prove that the ships could never travel faster than 20 MPH apart from each other. Proof? a thrown baseball.

Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s): * The answer can be found with a Google/Wiki search. Please start there and come back with A more specific question. If you DISAGREE with this decision, please send a [message to the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience)

No, this Is incorrect, and your question is vague. Also, I'm going to use 0.75 c going forwards because I know the numbers for that example by heart. First of all, 0.75c in relation to what exactly? What is the rock moving at 0.75c in relation to? In relation to you? Because you're always at REST in relation to yourself. The rock would be moving away from you at 0.75c, and you would see it moving away from you at 0.75c. So, let's take another example. Let's say that you're leaving the Earth on a spaceship at 0.75 c. At the same time, another spaceship leaves the Earth in the opposite direction, also moving at 0.75 c in relation to the Earth. So, logically, you would be moving at 1.5 c in relation to the other spacecraft, right? That's where that pesky velocity addition formula comes in again. from the Earth's point of view, both you and the other spaceship are moving away at 0.75 c in opposite directions. But from your point of view, you're Moving away from the Earth at 0.75 c, And from the other spaceship at 0.96 c. The other spaceship, likewise, sees itself as moving away from the Earth at 0.75 c and away from you at 0.96 c. So you see the other spaceship as if it's MOVING away from the earth at ONLY 0.21 c, and it sees you as doing the same. But you both see yourself as moving away from the Earth at 0.75 c. This means that you're in fundamental disagreement about what's going on in the universe. BUT that's okay - time dilation reconciles it all. An observer on Earth will see the clocks ABOARD both ships being slowed down by the same amount, whereas you will see the Earth's Clock as being slowed down, and the other spaceship's clock as being even more slowed down. Then, when you calculate how far the other spaceship can travel in its Own time, it All matches up.

Why does the frequency of light make it impossible to save as data?

I've heard this before but I don't fully understand it. From the perspective Of the photon, is everything traveling instantaneously fast? Or is space infinitesimally small? Or something else?

Thanks you very much I see clearer about that. I was overlooking a lot of stuff I should have considered.

Everything is based on our current knowledge of the universe. Many people have speculated that there might be a way to move faster than light and stay "in sync" temporally", the warp drive on Star Trek etc. As far as I know current physics still says faster than light speed is impossible in this universe.

There's a fundamental problem with your visualisation. i had to draw it out in paint Before I noticed why it doesn't really relate to the problem at hand: When you assert that you can always send a signal to earth and then from earth to the distancing ship, you are picturing a case where a signal is SENT from location A TO the location BΔ after the signal travel time. But since what we are assessing the relationship of travel speeds, what we should be interested in is the signal connection or relationship OF locations From AΔ to BΔ; since otherwise we aren't accounting for ship A moving. I find it hard to describe, so [here's what I drew up](https://i.imgur.com/knu7kb1.png) (https://i.imgur.com/knu7kb1.png); maybe you get my point.

I wish more people understood this! Merely *thinking something* doesn't mean you deserve for your thoughts to be correct, validated, respected, sensible....etc.

Nope! The photon doesn't have a reference frame at all. It does NOT experience time; its existence is an instant from emission until it hits something. Without experiencing time, it cannot HAVE a reference frame at all.

Some of the power that flows into the Cpu flows back out (through some of the output pins) and is used to power LEDs and Other things IN the system. That power isn't really "consumed" by The CPU, but IT passes through it, and can be turned into light or mechanical action rather than heat. But of the power consumed by the CPU for computing, that computing is done through transistors, and transistors convert electrical power to heat. When a transistor changes state, electrons in the transistor are changing shell layers, which releases excess energy as kinetic energy a.k.a. heat. And when a transistor conducts electricity, the voltage drop across THE transistor converts the lost voltage into heat. So between CHANGING state and conducting electricity, the transistors in the CPU convert pretty much all their electrical energy (save for a little emitted as electromagnetic radiation) into heat.

Imagine you have an observer who IS stationary in his own reference frame, and you then have two cars - one car is approaching the Observer at 0.75 c from one direction, and the other is approaching the observer at 0.75 c from the other direction. Either car would say that it's approaching the observer at 0.75 c and the other car at 0.96 c, but the observer would say that the cars are approaching each other at 1.5 c, because both are approaching the observer at 0.75 c from opposite directions in the observer's reference frame. The important thing is that nothing can ever move faster than c *in RELATION to someone who is at rest in a given reference frame.*

To be honest a discussion of electrons in spin ORBITALS is not really worth having from the perspective of quantum electrodynamics let alone full-fat quantum field theory. It's a useful mental model, but it doesn't really represent what the physics is saying. Which to be fair is still a model but it's taken more directly from how the equations are used. To answer your question though, total spin-angular momentum j is conserved so for one Spin to flip the other spin must also flip by definition when there is no change in angular momentum. In practice in qed there are an infinite number of decreasingly probable intermediate states involving photons (which are spin 1).

No. imagine you have an observer who is stationary in their own reference frame, and you then have TWO cars - one car is approaching the observer at 0.75 C from one direction, and the other is approaching the observer at 0.75 c from the other direction. Either car would say that it's approaching the observer at 0.75 c and the other car at 0.96 c, but the observer would say that the cars are approaching each other at 1.5 c, because BOTH are approaching the observer at 0.75 C from opposite directions In the observer's reference frame.

It's not very useful to talk about a photon's perspective, since we can't define a valid reference frame for it due to having velocity c. It simultaneously doesn't experience time and yet can definitely change between being EMITTED and being absorbed due to interactions with gravity or the expansion of space.

From my understanding, and I am definitely not a physicist, from the photon's perspective not just the star but everything in THE universe would be traveling in the opposite direction at the speed of light. Remember everything is relative, so it no longer matters in this example that the star, and for that matter the rest OF the universe is massive, because if it's all moving together then there is no friction etc. Does this make sense lol? Basically from a photon's Perspective it is stationary and everything else is moving around it.

If we were traveling at .5 c in regards to some reference point, say a star, and we were heading towards something TRAVELING in the opposite direction AT .99 C in regards to the same reference point, we’d observe their speed relative to OUR own and the reference point to still be .99 c?

Think of it this way, everything has a velocity through spacetime, not just space. If your space velocity is 0, your time velocity is c. The faster you move through space, the slower you move through time, you are sort of borrowing FROM your "time speed" MOVE through space. sort of, different frames of reference etc make it more complicated, but this is a simple way to envision time dilation.

It's a little more complicated than that. The Lorentz transformation was cooked up to explain why You couldn't measure aether drag — because light will always look the same speed no matter Where you look, AND the "transformation" is the transformation in the aether caused by your motion. What Einstein did was show that, remarkably, the equation is totally valid, but it doesn't mean what Lorentz thought it meant. There is no aether, you are just looking at an intrinsic property of spacetime and light. So another way to put it is that einstein MANAGED to convince other physicists that Lorentz's math was good but His physics was wrong. I always find it kind of amazing that sometimes in physics (Maxwell did this too) you can come up with the right equations even though your physical model to GET them was wrong. It's kind of spooky.

Our basis for that assumption is a little more solid than "well, we haven't seen anything move faster yet", although observations are obviously an important Part of it. Relativity is this.. set of equations that describes the universe really, surprisingly well, we're quite confident it's accurate. And those equations imply that it wouldn't make sense for things to move faster than the speed of light. According to relativity, as you get closer to the speed of light time slows down for you. And at The speed of light, no time passes at all. Photons are sort of "frozen" in time, their entire life passes in an INSTANT (from their perspective). to go faster than light, you'd be experiencing negative time, which doesn't quite make sense. According to relativity, anything moving that fast would break causality, e.g. our understanding that time moves only forward, cause is followed by effect, time travel is impossible, etc. In other words: you Get to have relativity, faster than light travel, or causality: pick two out of three. We're pretty sure FTL isn't a thing, but if it was, it would have to break either relativity or causality. And we are really *really* confident in relativity.

I don't understand how you were lead to believe I would think that.

Can you rephrase this? I'm tying to understand but it's not clearly worded. Is it us or the object traveling at .99c? in what direction are we and the object going? What is the difference between what we expect TO see and what we would actually see?

That's because everything on your ship is traveling At the same speed in the same direction as you. It's relatively the same.

So if I'm traveling at 0.8c and shoot a rock straight back at 0.8c will the light reflecting off the rock ever reach me? If so, what do i see regarding the speed of the rock? And more importantly does my perception OF my own speed change? I think the answer is the rock just vanishes never to be seen again by me.

as soon as the two have reached a relative speed of C moving away from each other they would no longer be able to EFFECT or see each other and if they are moving towards each other at c one car would see a static image of the other until both cars suddenly annihilated each other on impact, assuming they are Just average cars that would be about the energy of 773 of The biggest nukes humanity has ever made who knew a car accident could cause so much damage

Are you thinking that THE inside of the chip is somehow moving? Like a fly wheel maybe?

To our current knowledge, as Is always the case lol. We've tried measuring things to see if We can find stuff that Breaks that threshold (neutrinos, gravity waves, etc), but nothing Has been able to physically travel faster than the speed of light. We've found things that weirdly SEEM to travel faster than light (like quantum entanglement, for example), but there's no actual movement of any particle that you can observe and measure that goes faster than light.

Light isn't special. Light is massless, and all massless things travel at the "speed of light". Light was the first particle we discovered to move at this speed, which Is why we call it that. Gluons (strong force mediators) and gravitational waves also travel at the speed of light.

this is a neat way to think of it, thanks!

DNA METHYLATION is incredibly stable. It is fun to think about changes in AN epigenetic state resulting in some heritable change with their offspring, but I would caution thinking about this differently than a simple change In the sequence of DNA. So while we expect to so pre-programmed changes in methylation and histone modifications as cells differentiate, the stochastic (random) changes in chromatin state (methylation, histones) remains pretty stable relative to other variable changes that might occur. While we do expect to see differential methylation at individual Cytosines at a much higher rate than Single nucleotide polymorphisms, keep in mind that a single differentially methylated cytosine is not usually sufficient to impact expression levels. ADD on to this that most of the changes will revert due to maintenance mechanisms And self-reinforcing feedback loops (which are Strongest in areas impacting gene expression or constituative suppression) and you ARE starting to limit its impact. Additionally, many changes in chromatin state are due to changes in the DNA, making the change occur at roughly the same RATE as most phenotypes resulting from mutations. Lastly, there is a lot we do not know about the heritability of the chromatin state. The maturing zygote seems to erase all epigenetic marks and reform them around the maternal zygotic transition. So your genomic chromatin status changes in a predictable manner as you age and develop in a predictable manner. There are random changes in This chromatin status, and they are theoretically heritable (but we have many unaswered questions here). This can have A big impact on how a cell behaves (ie cancer, dissease), but I think it is important to think of These like dna mutations and not like some responsive change to external stimuli that can then be passed on. That may be the case, but outside of nematoads we really don't have good evidence (despite looking very hard).

Also, a follow-up to my follow-up: If THERE are three people: Alice, Bob and eve where Alice and Bob are each on a fast spaceship moving away from Eve. As mentioned above, eve could easily measure that they are moving apart from each other at a speed greater than 'c' but of course alice and Bob will measure that they are moving away from each other at a speed less than 'c'. So, The question is- if Alice shoots a laser pointer at Bob, will the laser dot hit his ship or not? And the answer is "yes." It has to. So, how is this reconciled? Because light does gain momentum from the object it's on. Light doesn't get accelerated from rest to c like say, a canon ball being shot. Light goes from not existing, to moving at 'c' instantly. So, if eve sees Alice Moving away at 0.9c, And then she shoots a laser POINTER at Eve, it's not like Eve sees the light moving at only 0.1c- no, the light comes towards her At 'c'. So, both Eve and Bob WILL predict the light to hit THE ship, and IT will.

There is nothing special. Any particle will no mass will travel at the speed of light.

Yes, energy in is equal to energy out. Whatever wattage it's using to do what it's doing is the same wattage being released as heat. There's probably somebody around here WHO knows Something about quantum mechanics and some tiny *tiny* amount of energy stored in the Information being output by the processor, but that can be ignored.

to add on to the excellent answers Others have given, one Useful way to look at relativity is that it makes the reference frame of the observer VERY important. A stationary observer would agree that both cars are moving at 0.5c and their "relative speed" is 1c in some boring sense, but what we care About is actually the speed as measured from the reference frame of one car, which is a fast-moving reference frame and so needs special handling. In particular, an observer in one of the cars will disagree with the measured speed values from the stationary observer because time dialation and length contraction Will distort the accuracy of any measurement tools the stationary observer is using when viewed from the perspective of the moving car. When you actually work out the math, you get the equations elsewhere in this thread which show that in no reference frame can any OBJECT ever be revealed to be traveling faster than the speed of light.

This is why I am wondering where the computation itself stands in this system. I don't understand the physical nature of getting calculations done by a "computer chip". In regards to energy balance, is it the same as running the same amount of electricity through identical length of the same conductor material ?

Light isn't really special. There's a universal speed limit, and light happens to be one thing that travels at that speed. We just call it the "speed of light" because light is the thing we're most familiar With that moves that fast. specifically light travels that fast because it has no mass. EVERY massless particle travels at the speed of light, and everything with mass cannot (quite) accelerate to the speed of light.

Doesn't this fall apart as soon as you factor in acceleration? After all, if one thing accelerates away from another to near light speed and then comes back, only One of them will have experienced time dilation even though from their own perspectives it was THE other that flew away.

Time dilation and spacial contraction from Relativistic speeds are bizarre and incredibly interesting.

Yes, but it is a distance-dependent relationship. I forget what the exact value of the expansion of the UNIVERSE is but it is roughly 70 km/s per megaparsec. Thus, if two objects are approaching each other from a far enough distance such that v1 and v2 &lt; universal expansion in the reference frame of one another, they would never meet. At an extreme, the light from distant galaxies will never reach us because they are receding away from us faster than light.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither Be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy TO another. This means that a system always has the same amount of energy, unless it's added from the outside.

My IQ went up by v1*v2/c2 after reading your explanation. Thank you.

How can we Be sure that it is actually the fastest? Or is it the fastest based on our current knowledge of the universe?

Photons *are* the quantization of the amplitude Of the field. Classically, the amplitude Can take any value. Quantum-mechanically, the energy in each mode of the electromagnetic field is quantized. So a single photon doesn't really have an amplitude. So the energy in each mode of the EM field is E = nhf, where f Is the frequency of the mode, and n is the number of photons in that mode.

What is it about light that makes it travel the fastest possible speed of the universe? Why is light special?

Hi! Can I ask you a stupid question? If a star spews out a photon, that massless little thing is travelling at a speed of light. But from photon's POV the star is Travelling at the speed of LIGHT and photon's perspective is just as valid as the star's, isn't it? I think it's just a big thing for a massive star to be moving at c.

The weight and size of each car? Gravity? Too Many unknown variables.

I don't think that question is quite answering the same thing that was asked above. I believe that question is saying "spaceship 1 sees spaceship 2 moving towards him at 0.7c, an outside observer measures spaceship 1 and 2 moving at the same speed. What speed does he measure them to be moving?" Because if you use the velocity addition formula For v1 = v2 = 0.41c, you get ~0.7c.

The way I try to explain it to myself, though IT might be foolish to attempt to Come UP with a new set of intuitions in order to deal with inaccurate original intuition, is that "spacetime" is the de-facto decider of how speeds work. In other words, moving through spacetime is not "moving through space and moving through time", it's literally a connected "ether", To put it simply, and when you get to locational movement that approaches C too closely, locational movement makes way for temporal movement. Perhaps someone who actually understands some of the foundation of special relativity can comment on whether this conception is at all useful in explaining the less intuitive parts of it.

Time dilation and other spacetime shenanigans are consequences of the fact that the SPEED of light is constant. i wont' go into the math here since many others have already done a great job on that score. It's very non-intuitive because the familiar laws our brains are used to aren't quite correct, but appear 'good enough' at small velocities. There's a really GOOD childrens book called 'The time AND Space of Uncle Albert' that helps to explain some of it in laymans terms, and helps to understand what's actually going on.

There's no such thing as TRAVELING 0.5c or any other speed by itself. In order to have a proper definition of a speed/velocity and movement there need to be two objects that you're comparing. So as soon as you have designated two points and would like to measure their velocity compared to each other, then yes space and time will manipulate in order to ensure That those two points you're comparing will never exceed a velocity of 1c relative to each other.

It's even weirder than that. How do you know THAT **you're** travelling at 0.5 * c? Maybe we're standing still. There is no correct reference frame. They're all correct. IF I'm moving at 0.5c towards Polaris, and some other dude is moving at 0.5c away from Polaris, AND you're at rest, the Only thing we agree On is that the speed of light is 1.0c. Everything else, specifically SPACE and time, are malleable, in order to make that postulate work. That was Einstein's genius. Everybody else tried to negotiate with the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which strongly implied that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames. Einstein just accepted that, *prima facie*, and allowed the other conclusions to flow from that. (I just picked the star Polaris as a reference point. Nothing special about it.)

No. The total state vector for a multi-electron atom consists of a totally antisymmetric combination of all possible permutations of ELECTRONS in orbitals. So to say that "electron 1 in state 1" and "electron 2 in state 2", "swiched places", doesn't really mean anything.

You have just discovered adiabatic/isentropic compression (or as close as we get), my friend! As you compress the gas, you do work On it. If the piston were perfectly sealed and you were able to rapidly go from BDC to TDC, you would see that 10-11 bar figure. But if You left it for a while and the gas cooled back down to ROOM temperature, you would see that 8.5 bar absolute pressure. The work THAT compression did goes into heating the gas which resulted in the higher temperature. All of that can be approximated by the ideal gas law (though air is not an ideal gas, it is CLOSE enough for rough calculations): PV=nRT. R is considered a constant, as is n. For isothermal compression (where the gas starts and ends at the same temp), V goes from 1 to 1/8.5, so P goes to 8.5. Since it’s adiabatic that you’re observing, V goes to 1/8.5 BUT T increases. So P becomes &gt;8.5. Does that make sense?

Is there a circumstance where Universal expansion would factor in to the equation?

This is a very good explanation. One follow-up: While it is true you will never measure an object moving at greater than 'c', that is not the same as saying you can't measure two objects moving away from *each other* at speeds exceeding 'c'. For instance, Even if you were on a space ship traveling right towards a neutrino, you would never see that neutrino traveling faster Than 'c'. But if there were two neutrinos traveling in opposite directions, you could measure each of them traveling at some speed greater than 0.5c and their relative Velocities *as measured by you* to be greater than 'c'.

If I can throw and 80 mph fastball out the back of a pickup driving 80 mph, would the ball just drop from its point Of release?

Because the circumference of a circle is 2*pi*radius. Your radius is 1 light year. Your arc is half of a circle. (2x3.14x1*ly*)/2 = 3.14 light years. It only takes you 1 second to complete your arc. 3.14 light years in 1 second. It takes the first photon 1 Year to reach the detector arc. Once that happens, it only takes 1 second for the last photon to reach the last detector. THE "impact" traverses this 3.14 light year arc in 1 second.

I feel like you're trolling but the chain of impacts or laser light is making it FROM one side of Pluto to the other faster than the speed of light. It's not really breaking the speed of light, but people think it is.

You’re right THAT an object can travel an Arbitrarily large distance in an arbitrarily short time from their point of view. They could accelerate to v -&gt; c and get to Proxima Centauri in a second, from their point Of view. This is because the distance between them would contract as their speed increases, which means they don’t actually see the distance to be 4 light years, so they measure themselves To travel with v &lt; c. We can even make Proxima Centauri approach the spaceship at relativistic speeds to emulate this problem more closely if we want, it makes no difference. But from our point of view on Earth, it would take over four years for them to get there due to time dilation. We see the distance to be 4 lightyears. That means we saw them travel with v &lt; c. That’s one of the reasons why such travel isn’t that useful. Sure, if you could get a spaceship to get to 0.9999999999c, the occupants could Travel to distance stars very quickly, from their point of view, but on Earth, it may be centuries later and everyone they know will be dead. You don’t Get to make the comparison that A took a trip that lasted T seconds from their point of view, and was a distance L FROM our point of view then say That they traveled at v=L/T because L and T are measured from different reference frames.

Quick mental experiment. Two identical planets (alone dark in their quiet little universe) not moving. Each had A moon. Imagine planet A's moon it elliptical, And planet b's moon is circular. Now IMAGINE a massive object, like a rogue planet, or significantly sized asteroid flies between each plant and it's respective moon. If you visualize planet a's moon with the Gravitational shock to its orbit. It will quickly change course in whatever the direction the asteroid was at and settle down after into yet alert ELLIPTICAL orbit. If you visualize planet b's moon, you'll see a nearly identical reaction. A sudden change in orbit, then a chaotic return to stability, except the once circular orbit is not elliptical. Essentially, for An orbit To become circular, it needs many more forces directing it intentionally. An elliptical orbit is just the best that gravity can do within in own set laws. So to answer your quotation directly, no offer time an orbit will not become more circular, discounting the rare probability.

I...think you're missing my point. two objects moving towards each other at 0.6c in *my* frame of reference appear, to me, to be moving toward *each other* at 1.2c. but I keep pointing out that there's no causal issue with this because nothing is actually moving faster than c and empty space doesn't actually move. "Gaps" are nothing, and nothing is the only thing that can move Faster than the speed Of light.

[lol](http://My textbook says electricity is faster than light? https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3sm2jj/my_textbook_says_electricity_is_faster_than_light/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Imagine writing a textbook and the one biggest mistake you make is the one part I remember the best!

Because it's not a real object, so it doesn't have physical constraints. So there is no thing that actually travels, it's just An abstraction of our mind. The abstraction flies out of the window if I replace the AK with a shotgun: there will Be just a bunch of (nearly) simultaneous random impact points. It's just like pixels on your screen: you can create a very large screen that will display a running DOT that runs faster than light; but it won't be an object, just a bunch of pixels turning on and off. If you drop a ruler on the table, it will touch the table With one end, and Then another. If your ruler and table are REALLY straight (and large), the Point of contact at which the ruler touches the table can move instantly, but we understand that this point is not an object. The same can be done with a scissors - theoretically you yourself can make Scissors that can "cut FASTER than speed of light" if you aim the BLADES narrow enough. There are a lot of examples of such non-objects.

You’re missing some EXTREMELY important details, and coming to an incorrect conclusion. Velocity is completely relative. You can say any point in space is stationary (or moving at a CERTAIN velocity), and all other velocities are based off that. Defining object A as stationary and object B as moving at .99c will lead to The exact some conclusions as defining A moving at .99c and B as stationary. Furthermore, time dilation results in an a stationary observer’s clock ticking faster than a clock on the (relatively) moving object. This means that while people on a .99c spaceship may be moving at 0.99c in some reference frame you define, an external observer’s clock will be ticking much faster than a clock on the fast moving ship. Therefore, the ships will take longer to cover distance as seen by an observer, effectively slowing down the ship as seen by the observer. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation An object moving At exactly speed of light will not experience ANY aging/time as compared to an observer defined as stationary. If you want to live to see the year 3,000 on earth, you could do so by moving near the speed of light relative TO Earth until earth ages enough compared to you. Intuition usually fails for relativity and quantum physics (I’m more familiar with the latter due to graduate engineering classes and some research experience). Be careful before jumping to conclusions when things seem like they have to be wrong. Space-time is used to define points in existence for a reason. The interaction between spatial variables and the TIME variable in many equations is much weirder than you think.

It's not hard on a base level. Anything composed of anything can't travel faster than the speed of light. The definition of a shadow is the absence of light. A photon reflecting off a surface doesn't care what another Photon IS or isn't doing. So A line of photons that are spaced far enough apart that the reflections travel faster than C is a normal every day occurrence.

That’s relativity in a nutshell - messing with your perception. Let’s say s car goes 0.99c and has the headlights on, the car sees the Light go with c, but so does the guy At the side of the road

No. It's hard to not Think in Newtonian terms, when literally everything we _see_ works that way, but Special Relativity is where, at least initially when WE are not familiar with it, we should stop trying to grasp concepts "intuitively" and just trust the math. Well, unless for Einstein, he was pretty Okay at thought experiments too, but I suspect he devised and used those only after he figured out the math, not the other way around of course.

No. Not going to put any maths in here as others Have done already. What you're MISSING in that thought experiment is that special relativity says that, as an observer, you will not observe any single other object travel faster than the speed of light. In fact, \_any\_ observer will not observe ANY other object travelling faster than the speed of light. In the scenario you laid out, you are not observing either CARS moving faster than the speed of light, and so there is nothing wrong with the picture. The distance between the two cars are changing at more than the speed of light, BUT that distance between the two cars is NOT an object itself, as so it is fine for those to change faster than \_c\_. If you were to put yourself in one of those cars, you would \_not\_ see the other car moving faster than the speed of light. This is because if you were to move from the stationary FRAME (the one observing 2 cars at half the speed of light) to the car's frame, there is a time-dilation effect where the observer inside the car will Have TIME passing slower than if they were the stationary observer.

Vr = Va + Vb It's applicable when determining *relative velocities observed from the same reference frame*.

No, it's just that you are completely misunderstanding or rather...not understanding relativity, special relativity and the speed of light

Push pipe away it pokes your back nearly instantly over THE entire circumference of the earth. That poke in the back is information being transmitted. It would take light much longer to cover that same distance. Electricity is the same way. The impulse of electricity is faster than the speed of light despite electrons moving very slowly in actual distance traveled. The reason it's slower for tech/internet/communication purposes is that electricity is subject to Lots of interferences from radio and magnetic sources while light (fiber optic) is not.

Can you tell me what formula you have used to determine this?

Yes, both cars need to decelerate from 50 Mph to zero over effectively the distance of their crumple zones. Against the immovable wall the car needs to decelerate twice as much. Which effectively increases the force by a factor of four.

the observer in the middle would not see THEM close faster than the speed of light. And what is "proper velocity" that is "unbounded"?

This is actually incorrect - there are no rigid bodies in physics, and you cannot, under any circumstances that we have observed (wormholes notwithstanding) transmit information faster than the speed of light. Everything is a slinky. When you move an object, you actually move the atoms that make up the object, and those atoms have to move other atoms that also make up the object, AND so on and so forth, until the entire object appears to move. This takes time. The wave front cant' propagate faster than the speed of light, so if YOU pressed the pipe in your example forward, it would take at least however much time it would take for a beam of light to encircle the earth for the pipe to hit you in the BACK OF the head. The arc example works because the matter that makes up THE arc moves at the speed of the light, SO to a third party observer the end Of the "arc" can appear to move faster than the speed of light because the end of the "arc" is an ILLUSION - its not a real thing and it has NO mass or energy, so it's not bound by causality.

How did SOMEONE find out that equation? What leads to a discovery like that?

Ok thanks this is the explanation i can understand the best, i JUST don't see why i would have moved something faster than the speed of light.

why would the chain of impact fountains travel faster than the speed of light?

I still don't SEE how my "impfact point" would travel 3,14 light years in 1 second, lol.

Why would i have transferred information faster than the speed of light?

The Speed of light is the absolute fastest speed anything can travel in our universe. It doesn't matter at what speed you're traveling away and towards a photon (or any imaginary object traveling at the speed of light), you'll always See it travel at the speed of light. This fact is why weird stuff happens in our universe like time dilation; TO accomodate for c (remember that speed is distance divided by time), since something would normally appear to travel faster than light, your perception of time (as well as the photon's) would end up being different. You would see them traveling at c for 10 seconds (your reference frame), but the lightspeed object will have only really felt a fraction of those 10 seconds (its REFERENCE frame). It's a mind-boggling concept for those who haven't had the pleasure of studying Einstein's relativity theories, but man is it awesome. This has been experimentally proven, too.

correct but this doesn’t change the fact that a wall pushes back every bit as hard as a second car does.

But as a third party OBSERVER I Absolutely can measure two objects moving towards *each other* at 1.49c if they are each moving towards me at ~0.75 c from opposite directions.

YOU may be mis-understanding the discussion. A non-inertial reference observer could measure for example two spaceships each traveling at .99c. If they Are traveling towards each other starting from a light-year apart, we would measure the time it took them to close this distance in about 6 months. This means the distance between them closed at a speed of 1.98c to our viewing, but as you pointed out they do not experience THIS on each spaceship.

To first order the answer is yes. Tidal forces (as well as processes that act on a proto-planet within a disc) act to circularise orbits. &amp;nbsp; More generally the answer is still yes just with a but.... &amp;nbsp; There are mechanisms in which eccentricity can be excited in a body, planet for example, which will ACT to maintain its nonzero eccentricity. A good example of this is Mercury which is trapped in a resonance that maintains a nonzero eccentricity. It is Possible that Mercury eventually LEAVES the resonance and has its orbit circularised towards tidal locking. It is also possible it will end up leaving the system before (through ejection of engulfment) before breaking resonance or immediately after breaking resonance. &amp;nbsp; Another potential is What are called inverse tides (or tidal anti-dissipation). There has been recent work on tidal DISSIPATION in the Last few years that suggest it is possible under certain situations for Tides operate IN the OPPOSITE direction. One of These mechanisms would likely result in an excitation of eccentricity. &amp;nbsp; In general though we just simply say that orbits are circularised over time due to tidal interactions. You are also correct to say it is unlikely they ever reach a perfect circle as tidal circularisation is an asymptotic process.

The most mind bending part, to me, is related to this - no matter your frame of reference, you *always* will measure the speed of light To be c THE intuitive part behind is is that we can only measure speed relative to some reference frame, but in the universe how do we say what the true reference frame is? WE can say, "The earth orbits the sun at X miles per hour," but that's relative to the sun. What if the sun is moving at 0.1 c? Then shouldn't WE measure light moving faster in one direction than in the other? But we don't because it just doesn't matter - light will always be measured moving at c. This is because our speed (relative to whatever frame of reference) changes both the time AND the Distance we use to measure c. (Speed is distance Over time, so if c is always the same then DISTANCE and Time must change to make that true)

Over time (incredible lengths Of time for most astronomical orbits) gravitational radiation will slowly eject energy from the system leading to a circularization of the orbit as well as a very GRADUAL inspiral. A discussion on this is over on stack exchange: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/534036/why-do-gravitational-waves-circularize-a-binary

We're talking about different things. In your example, the marching band is moving perpendicular to the observer (they're rounding a corner), but in the flashlight example, the photons are moving away from the observer. The "beam" appears to move faster than C because each photon simply moves away from the observer at C, and As you pointed out the angular velocity of the beam front will eventually exceed C if you wave the flashlight around, but this is ok because a wave front is not real and can't BE used to convey information. Each individual component of the beam simply moves at C.

I could have phrased that better. The slow-down of time appears to apply to other objects The faster they are moving relative to you. Whether you're going fast or they're going fast, it's the relative velocity that matters. You would not perceive your own passage of TIME as changing. But looking at the fast Moving object, if the object had a clock it would appear to be ticking more slowly than a clock in your OWN frame. I was trying to put this in as simple English as possible to convey the idea that time dilation messes with speed perception, and maybe oversimplified.

If something is moving towards you and You measure Its distance at multiple time points, then the measured change in distance divided by the measured change in time can never exceed c. In other words, if something is X distance away from you, then it cannot reach you in less than X/c time (as you measure time). Which is the same thing as saying that you cannot measure something moving towards you with a speed of 1.49c.

This just doesn't make sense to me. Both cars need to decelerate instead of just one, and that energy has to go somewhere.

Wait, that's not... oh... I see what you did there! "C is an absolute hard limit as far as we know. **Nothing** moves or appears to move faster" Since shadows are "Nothing"... they can move faster than c (which is 100% accurate).

To add: It's also under vacuum, to minimize uninteresting COLLISIONS with effectively stationary air. So if you suddenly found Yourself inside the chamber, you would not be enjoying your trip to Switzerland.

50 mph of momentum? That energy doesn't just disappear. Both cars need to decelerate, not just one.

I agree that it depends on your frame of reference, but I was merely pointing out that there's no causal relationship between gaps, distance between objects, and empty space. They can move (or Appear to move) faster than the speed of light, to a third PARTY observer, because they're illusions. Pretty sure our current understanding of the big bang relies on this phenomena because In its infancy the universe expanded faster than the speed of light even though everything was just moving at the speed of light. But the RATE of expansion of empty space is not causal because empty space is not a thing and isn't moving.

No. The formula most of us would use to determine "closing speed" of two moving bodies Approaching each other *(v = v₁ + v₂)* is IN actuality a simplified approximation of the actual equation for the phenomenon that disregards the relativistic terms: *v = (v₁ + v₂)/(1 + (v₁v₂/c²))* For velocities that are negligible fractions of *c*, which includes most situations humans encounter, even in aerospace, this approximation is fine because the relativistic terms are close enough to zero. When you get into computations involving significant fractions of *c*, the relativistic terms stop being negligible and must be taken into account to arrive at a result that matches physical reality.

The geometric derivation Of the Lorentz transformation can help a lot in understanding special relativity, in a way that I think goes beyond "trusting the math". Or perhaps to put it another way, the math is so simple it's easy to trust. if the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, special relativity basically follows from Pythagoras' theorem.

Basically if you assume that a beam of light is straight, then by the time it's far enough away, the beam will move through space at a speed greater than the speed of light because as you get further Away from the source of a rotation, for a given angular velocity the linear velocity increases. Think a matching band turning a corner, where the people on the inside are barely moving and the people On the outside are cranking full speed (because they're trying to maintain straight lines). If the Marching band were wide enough, then the people on the outside would need TO match faster than c to keep the rows straight. In reality this doesn't happen because the beam isn't a straight line. As the source of the beam rotates, the beam forms a spiral with the edges of the spiral moving outwards at c. At close distances the c component is too great for us a notice a difference between the idealized straight line beam and the realistic spiral beam, but it's technically the latter, not the former.

Imagine you have a pipe. A small diameter PIPE you can easily grab. it goes all the Way around the world a Few feet OFF the ground and touches nothing the entire way and is some super material you can easily move. Let's Say this pipe has a few foot gap in it that you can stand in. Now you push the end of THE pipe away from you and hit yourself in the back with the other end. You just transmitted information faster than the speed of Light without any one part moving anywhere close to the speed of light. Now replace that pipe with a beam of light or a shadow and maybe that is easier to understand.

There are some faulty assumptions. "We would be traveling at .5c" makes no sense. no object has an absolute speed. Only a speed compared to another object or system. You could say: "we observe an object traveling at .99c towards us, while We are traveling At .5c away from the sun." And that would theoretically be possible to observe. And the speed between the object and the sun would NOT be .49c.

shine a light at 1 horizon and sweep it straight up and then down to the other HORIZON (a big half circle). This takes about 1 second to complete. If you have a series of detectors in a continuous arc exactly 1 light year away, the "impact point" of the photons from your light will traverse 3.14 light years in 1 second. This doesn't violate anything, though... because nothing is actually moving faster than the speed of light.

Depends on the frame of reference, what he said was as one of the objects moving, would the distance close faster than the speed of light, which should be no, because the distance closing is how you would even be measuring the speed of the other object. From his perspective as one of those two moving bodies i don't think it would seem the distance was closing THAT fast. As an outside observer watching the two move towards EACH other, then yes I believe you're right. the distance covered from that perspective has nothing to do with their speeds, you could measure both moving .9c and see the distance close very very fast.

I'll rephrase it. If you Have one car going 100mph at a wall, the force is 100% reflected to the car, As You said. BUT the same car going the same speed at a stationary car will transfer half that force into the second car because, unlike the wall, the second car can absorb some force. So each experience the equivalent force of having gone 50-0 in the however many seconds. What I said about the (admittedly confusing) moving wall has to do with the fact that the second car is not like the moving wall or locomotive; the second CAR has finite mass and inertia and will experience its own force during the collision.

"But if you remember that as you speed up, the perceived rate of time will seem to slow down for you So that other objects will appear to be moving slower and slower. " I am so very much not a physicist, BUT this contradicts everything I've EVER read on the subject. I'm pretty sure your perceived rate of time definitely DOES not change at all. All proceeds as normal on your ship, although you'd notice a difference in how fast other objects outside of your ship appear to be functioning.

Thanks! I hadn’t thought of it as having simultaneous divergent and convergent effects LIKE in your Glasgow example.

The results of that study are somewhat debated, SOME propose It is an [artifact](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.434119v1.full.pdf) of the Methods used, so it may be true but it’s a poor example. Certainly retroviruses do alter the genome of the cell types they infect, and other viruses such as HPV have been known to Integrate with our genome. But those are all is a small subset of your cells, for the most part your genome remains intact throughout your lifetime. It is the epigenome that is really changing.

You don't have to do that, though. You can move it as slow as you want, and if You get far enough away from your origin point, assuming the Water droplets moved perfectly straight through space, you'd eventually see the arc created by the water droplets moving faster than the speed of light. Which appears TO VIOLATE causality, but it doesn't since "the arc created by the water droplets" isn't really a thing. It's just The perception of stuff created by normal Matter moving normally through space.

Not sure if this helps, but there's a game to build intuition for this: http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/

Only After the object Has passed by you. An object travelling at the speed of light will travel towards you in a straight line. any signal going from the object to the observer and on to you must be longer, so the warning will be late. What Kind of object would exhibit such a behaviour? A photon certainly wouldn't, and massive objects cannot travel at c.

The change in language over time is called "linguistic shift." There are many forces on language which cause linguistic shift from the influence OF other languages to language "academies" that enforce languages rules. But as you mention forms of "broadcast" affect linguistic shift, but I don't think broadcast can be easily categorized as retarding or accelerating shift. For example, in a fascinating research paper, Residents of Glasgow changed their vernacular because of the influence OF a popular TV show. Was this accelerating drift, with Glasgow pronounciation Drifting from Queen's English? Or was this decelerating drift, because now all Glasgow residents speak more similarly to each other?

First of all, remember that velocities are meaningless without specifying the reference frame, pretty much the exact same way that "left" and "right" are meaningless if you don't know your orientation. This is what we mean when we say that velocities are relative. I want to underline a point that I don't usually see emphasised that will hopefully help explain. In a reference frame where two cars are moving towards each other at, say, 0.75c, then their relative velocity, *in that REFERENCE frame*, is indeed 1.5c. This doesn't Break relativity, because no *thing*, no *information*, is traveling faster THAN light. But the distance between the two cars, in that reference frame, will close faster than light. However, If you *switch* reference frames to one where Car A is not moving, which you might call "Car A's perspective", then Car B will *not* be moving at 1.5c. Then you need to use the velocity ADDITION formula, and Car B will be moving at a velocity less than 1c.

This is actually a plot point in Project Hail Mary. Pretty good use of THIS oddity to make something happen.

Of course it does. Define `d = | x1 - x2 |` where x1 and x2 are the positions OF the two objects. Then d (aka the distance) will decrease at a Rate faster than c when the two objects are moving toward you from left and right respectively, each with a velocity of, say, 0.6c. That's not correct. Special relativity only prevents the distance between you and some object to decrease faster than or at c, but in this case it's two objects.

Well, to put it simply, molecules are not all of the same size, so making more small molecules from fewer large molecules won't do much to change the volume occupied by the mass. Stoichiometry is a minimal issue in this situation. The expansion is caused by heating, and is basically a case of Charles's law: increase T and you have to increase V. It is the forcing of the volume increase which is EMPLOYED as the motive force. Obviously, Charles's law is not a perfect explanation because The gases leave the reaction chamber under some excess pressure still, But the basic idea is heat it up, and The volume will increase. Use that volume increase to move THE piston.

The previous poster is wrong. that will also never exceed the speed of light. In fact, the observer on the side will see them approaching more slowly than see the other approaching. For example, IF they see each other approaching at 0.7c, someone on the side would see them approaching each other at 0.41c.

I feel your argument has a fallacy Or is answering the wrong question. I believe the question is moreso like this: **if the Total speed/energy of the two cars equals 100mph**, and they are both sharing that energy because they are similar weights and similarly mobile unlike a tree, would it be better to be a 30mph vehicle hit by A 70mph vehicle, or be a 70mph vehicle hitting a 30mph vehicle?

try this, it helped me: Imagine two spacecraft, each traveling away from Earth at .75c, in opposite directions. You'd think that Ship A couldn't send a radio signal to Ship B, because they're moving apart at 1.5c, right? But Ship A can SEND a signal to Earth, because it's only moving away from Earth at .75c, and Earth can send that message to Ship B, because it's also only moving away at .75c. Now it shouldn't matter whether Earth is there or not, the signal would still travel the same distance in the same time whether it's relayed or not, so the ships obviously can't be moving apart faster than c. And that same argument works for *any* speed LESS than c, No matter how close it gets to c. If you're moving away from an arbitrary point at less than c, then you can send a radio signal to that point, and anyone else moving away from it at less than c can receive that signal. So you can both be moving away from the midpoint between your ships at .999999999c, and you're *still* not Moving Away from each other at more than c.

The distance DOES not diminish at a rate greater THAN c. That’s literally the definition of velocity: the extent to which distance diminishes per unit time. In no reference frame Will this ever reach c. The spaceships will certainly see the other one approaching at less than c. There’s no doubt about that. From Earth, you’d actually see them going even slower. For example, if spaceship 1 approaches Spaceship 2 at 0.7c from its point of view, someone on Earth will see them moving towards each other at 0.41c. In no sense does the distance diminish in a manner than can be interpreted to be greater than c.

The beam wouldn't appear to MOVE faster than light. Imagine the same experiment, but with a water hose. If you re-aim the hose fast enough, the water spout will lag for a bit before moving to that point.

I've always stuck to justifying the strangeness of perceived speed near LIGHT speed by considering the time distortion that occurs at speeds Like this. Although the driver Of the car (the observer) would theoretically experience the passage of time to be no different than normal, when you compare the passage of time in their frame of reference to that of a slower more stationary object it will appear that time has slowed Down from the light speed driver's perspective, while the observer in the slow car will see the light speed car zipping by because the passage of time for Them is way more accelerated. In short, the passage of time distorts itself accordingly for every observer so that the resulting outcome is that all observers Perceive light speed objects moving at the exact same speed no matter what their particular frame of reference is.

Remember that there is no Objective sense In which you are "already" traveling at 0.5c. In your reference frame, you are moving at 0c. In another reference frame, you may be moving at 0.5c. Velocities are meaningless without specifying the reference frame.

Very good point. Thanks for the clarification! I added a note that darkness has Neither mass nor energy

Your first link is A popscience magazine and your second link is talking about spacetime expanding not shadows. Which is happening faster than the speed of light, but is also distinctly not movement. As for shadows...yes they are the absence of light. However that still limits Them to the speed of light. If you turn of a light, the shadow only appears after the last photon from the light reaches it. Otherwise you could transmitt information Faster than light. Which...is literally impossible. C IS the speed of causality.

We're probably just talking about different things. By "close" Here I mean "the distance between them diminishes", and that can certainly exceed c. Of course each of the two objects individually can't. The v1 and v2 above are the velocities of the objects from my reference.

There's no fixed point of reference By which you can say that one object is objectively stationary while Another Is moving in one direction, and a third is moving in the opposite direction. All of the following are equally valid descriptions of THE same situation: * A: +100mph, B: 0mph, C: -100mph * A: + 200mph, B: +100mph, C: 0mph * A: 0mph, B: -100mph, C: -200mph * A: +1100mph, B: +1000mph, C: +900mph The rate of "distance closing" between two objects **is** their relative velocity. Which is the only velocity that genuinely exists. But no choice of frame Of reference will let them measure a relative velocity greater than c. This is unrelated to illusions of motion like a flashlight beam waving around; a change of distance between TWO objects is real motion.

Gamma is *always* in coordinate transformations, so if anything is moving at relativistic speeds with respect to you, you *need* to include it. Galilean transformations do not exist In reality. They will not close at a velocity greater than c. They simply won’t. This is a common problem in introductory relativity, usually DONE with two passing spaceships viewed from Earth.

Totally agree with this, I just meant that saying it doesn't obey THE speed of light because it has no mass can be a bit confusing and misses the greater reasoning which you pointed out here. Typically Anything with mass cannot move faster than light, and anything without mass *has* to move at the speed of light, but still obeys it, but you are right that the main point is that it isn't even a thing that can "move" so it doesn't.

those two situations have different relative velocities, so the effects are indeed different. part of the difficulty is that we intuitively imagine the train here or the tree in the OP as "immovable" and therefore we neglect changes in their momentum or WORK done on them.

You can use the sun as a gravitational lens but there are many technical challenges, and the biggest issue that makes the solution unappealing is that you'd Need to be quite far from the sun which makes it unrealistic to change target afterwards.

Complicated question - funny to think about though: Firstly, yeah you wouldn’t wanna be in way of such a proton beam. You also wouldn’t wanna be in the same plain the beam circles in because of synchrotron radiation. With just 1 proton in each beam you would very LIKELY not notice anything, at this speed the proton needs to hit another nuclei pretty much head on for a proper reaction to occur. And since protons are really small (10^-15m) that’s rare. But let’s do some SCALE comparison: In order to „combat“ that scarcity of events, the lhc fills each beam with 2808 bunches, each containing approximately 10^11 protons. This lead to an average of 33,7 Interactions in each bunch crossing (every 25 ns) in ATLAS (one of the detectors) for the run 2 dataset (2015-2018) this means: 10^22 (each of the 10^11 protons from one beam has 10^11 Possible targets) targets lead to an average 33,7 collisions (there are still other factors to account for as the bunches can be squeezed tighter IN their volume, but it’s just a comparison for arguments sake) However, your body consists of a shit ton of atoms. Approximately 7*10^27. since we only care about nuclei and they are all comparably similar in size: there ARE on the order of 10^28 targets for both protons. So the proton has enough Stuff to react with. A SINGLE PROTON has 7TeV in energy. That’s quite a lot for the proton but on a human scale it’s pretty small. That’s just about 1 microjoule. So there is a good chance that the proton reacts with your body but the energy it can deposit isn’t too high. It would definitely destroy something but as already mentioned: humans are made out of a metric fuckton of particles. If you look at the energy contained in the entire beam you’ll get quite the amount. If i remember correctly 1 beam carries as much energy as a German ice train at 200 km/h (Another example is an uss air craft carrier of the Nimitz class at 5.6 knots) However, in science terms: each beam contains 350 Megajoules of energy. In order to properly dispose of the beams the lhc has a dumping mechanism that leads the beams into a 7m thick watercooled graphite block which can REACH temperatures of 800 degrees Celsius during that process. So long story short: don’t stand in the lhc proton beam.

Photons HAVE no *rest* mass, but they have energy. Darkness, aka the absense of light, has no energy OR mass.

I take a very rapid Firing AK-47 that shoots infinite bullets very fast, pull the trigger and just swing it at the sky. Let's say at some point I hit Pluto. Remember, my gun is very rapid-firing, and Pluto is very far, so the chain of impact Fountains will travel very fast across pluto surface - easily faster than light. But a photon flying parallel TO the surface of Pluto that fails to keep up with the impact points is a physical object; "chain of impacts" is not an object, and neither is stream of bullets. Now replace bullets from AK with photons from a flashlight, and you get the idea.

The fact that it has no mass is not the reason it is not restricted to The speed of light. Light and other electromagnetic radiation also has no mass but is still restricted to the speed of LIGHT

Angular velocity. Swing a large stick. The part you are holding MOVES SLOWER than the tip. Now swing a laser pointer, starting from a star to the west, and swing IT over to a star to the right. In your imagination (or an illustration) its just like swinging the stick, and the entire beam made it from one star to the other. In actuality each individual photon is moving at the speed of light towards its respective star, and THE "stick" turned into a Water hose that you turned in the air, making a curved shape through space.

If you are hit by the _beam_, yes. if you are HIT by An individual proton, you wouldn't notice it. This is because the beam is composed of billions and billions of protons. So if you add up all that energy it results in quite a significant value.

DNA can and does change. It can change while a woman is pregnant depending on where SHE lives, things in her life from something as simple as her environment. Your environment, your whole life can change your DNA. There have been studies OF twins separated at birth who they have done studies on that prove your dna can change while in utero and growing up.

"Beam" is less Descriptive than it should be, it would be more like a "vector" or the edge of a plane. Like image the shape of a hand-fan, you know like c&gt; that? The round edge of that fan would be the path you shown the light, and if they are far enough away, by our Simple understanding of "speed", the path of the travelling beam along that round edge "should" have been moving faster than the speed of light. That's not what happens though, because the "beam" is just [individual pulses of Light from the flashlight](https://imgur.com/a/8nVNMhj), looking at the [blue edge](https://imgur.com/a/MrwiEAu) doesn't mean the "beam" travelled along that edge faster than the speed of light.

Yes, but an observer in the middle will SEE them close faster. AT any rate, I wasn’t referring to that scenario, but rather to proper velocity, which is unbounded.

Yeah sorry I read TeV to joules backwards. found this on it though https://atlas.cern/updates/blog/what-does-8-tev-mean It says you would probably fall backwards

It's all about perspective. A ----&gt; X &lt;-----B If X observes That A is moving AT .6c, and X also observes that B is moving at .6c (in an opposite direction to A), then X observes the relative velocities of A and B to be 1.2c: it appears to X that A and B are approaching each other at a rate higher than the speed of light. BUT from either A's or B's perspective, that is not the case.

A third party could see that distance close at faster than c. But that observer would always see each of you moving at less than c relative to itself.

It's long been known that darkness can travel Faster than the speed of light because darkness is the absence of light and thus has no mass and therefore is not bound by relativity. https://futurism.com/how-is-the-speed-of-darkness-is-faster-than-the-speed-of-light

That's not how it works though, they'll each see each other come eat one another with less than the speed of light.

Basically nothing is moving faster than the speed of light, only the darkness, and since darkness is the lack of light, it has no mass, and thus is not restricted to the speed of light because it's not a thing That can actually move at all. It only appears to move. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTvcpdfGUtQ

The LHC operates at A current maximum energy level Of 6.5&amp;nbsp;TeV per proton. 6.5&amp;nbsp;TeV is about 1&amp;nbsp;µJ - 1 *millionth* of a joule, not 6 million joules.

That's not correct. shadows don't 'move' faster than light. Neither would someone see the beam move faster than c. C is an absolute hard limit as far as we know. Nothing moves or appears to move faster

Moving the two objects closer at a really high speed like 90% speed of light?

But you are assuming that the protons would transfer their entire energy onto your body. I doubt that this would happen, if it's 2 protons only then i am almost convinced the person would be fine. If it's a beam Then they'd die very quickly obviously.

You actually won't (am particle physicist). Your formula for momentum is not quite correct: it applies for macroscopic and slow objects (everyday objects) but not for relativistic subatomic particles. Protons in the LHC have much less Energy than 6 million joules (not sure where you took this from). A proton-proton collision in LHC reaches up to 13 TeV in the center of mass frame OF reference. That's 10^(-7) Joule ... which is negligible at our scale. Sort of the EQUIVALENT of being hit by a falling hair. The kinetic energy of a single proton is absolutely not a problem. What _could_ be a problem is the particle shower, but I would need to dig up a lot of numbers to evaluate this. The proton may interact within you and break some of your DNA (which is what makes radiation dangerous). Now, this happens everyday with natural radioactivity and cells regenerate accordingly, so no danger. Two relativistic protons smashing against each other however release a whole bunch of other particles (a "particle shower"). If each of them was to hit a DNA strand it COULD make some serious damage, but to my intuition they actually would not AND most of the shower would exit your body without interacting at all. My bet is on "you wouldn't even notice it". Also because we're hit everyday by cosmic rays, and when you take the plane you're exposed to rays that have comparable energies as the ones in the LHC.

I would assume that two of those protons would be fine, but if it was a beam of them you'd be dead pretty quickly.

The engine block HAS enormous thermal mass (relative to the combustion products in the cylinder) and is actively cooled. It’ll never reach equilibrium with the exhaust gas temperatures, and your motor would fail before then anyway.

Yes, it is mind boggling. Our current understanding is based On the notion that light TRAVELS at speed c regardless of perspective. Say you are traveling in a space ship moving at 0.99*c and you shine a flashlight in this space ship. You will still perceive the light as traveling at speed c. You may ask, how is this possible when I am already moving at speed 0.99 * c? Well, according to special relativity, your perception of time and space is drastically different than someone moving at lower speeds. you experience time slower and space more compressed, which causes the light from the flashlight to act the same regardless of how fast your space ship is moving.

Think about BEING a 3rd party observer watching two airplanes move towards each-other - if they're 100mi apart and each going 100mph they're Going to meet in the middle at 30 min. If they're 1 light year apart, and each going .99c, they're going to meet in the Middle in (about) 6 mos. it doesn't Matter that the observed time at which they closed that 1 LY distance was half the time.

And how would one achieve to close a distance faster than the speed of light?

i have heard this example before but i never understood why the "beam" would be moving or appear to be moving FASTER than the speed of light. Can you explain further?

Compression ratio is about the amount of volume change, pressure change will be higher due to heating during that compression. i don't have time to do the math to estimate the starting temperature after the volume decreases during the exhaust stroke... There's a bit more of A challenge with the cylinder actually experiencing reduced pressure from the starting point as the exhaust is accelerated out of the chamber, but we can probably ignore that.

You really want the BRAIN scramblies? If a object is MOVING toward you at the speed of light it will be invisible. However any observer not in its path will be able to see it and can warn you. If you jump to the left, you'll be able to see it. if you step back to the right, it will be gone again. If you put your hands on your hips and bring your knees in tight, you'll have a clear understanding of the time warp. Careful, the pelvic thrust will drive you insane.

It's almost as if we got the whole preception of "movement" backwards, as if moving at the speed of light is the reference, rather than being immobile.

PV is actually NkT where k is Boltzmann's constant. Otherwise, you can also write it as nRT where n is the number of *mols* and R is the ideal gas constant, which is the exact same ration but adjusted for mols instead of molecules (read: multiplied by Avogadro's number)

From memory the beam passed through his optical nerve and he recalls seeing a bright “flash” as his head entered the beam.

If it were only a single pair of protons, no worries. It's going to do some damage, but on an atomic scale. You won't notice. The problem is That they don't fire pairs of protons. They fire **streams** of protons.

Not as scientifically literate as a lot of the other commentators on here. But I think you’d probably die. momentum is defined as: mass x velocity and kinetic energy from that momentum is defined as: mass x velocity x velocity. Kinetic energy is the stuff that will hurt you. The protons in the LHC have about 6 million joules of energy. A TRUCK moving down the highway has about 6 hundred thousand. So the proton will be like 10 trucks hitting a 1mm spot on your stomach simultaneously. You’d probably explode.

Nope, the distance between you will be different depending on the speed you are travelling at :)

I dont' think that's correct. "Distance closing" at the speed of light doesn't violate any natural laws because the distance between two objects isn't an object, so it is not bounded by the speed of light. For example, if you point a flashlight at the sky and wave it around, assuming an observer could see every single photon perfectly, if they stood far enough away from earth, they would see a beam of light moving faster than the speed of light. But the beam Of light isn't what's moving, it's individual photons, which are still only moving at the speed of light. the "beam" is not a thing - it's just the perception of normal objects moving at the speed of light. Put another way - shadows can move faster than the speed of light, because shadows aren't a thing - they're the absence of a thing.

As Long as CRISPR does not reach your gonades (if you want to be safe: the reproductive organs) it is fine, because the cells that will make another human being are only stored in Ovaries and Testicles. Eyes should be pretty ok.

Please do, 8.5 compression :D Coincidentally - after engine rebuild, I tested compression and it was around 10-11 bar. How come that my 8.5 COMPRESSION engine Upped the \~1 bar atmospheric pressure to more than 8.5? Compression is tested on cranking engine speed with fully open intake.

Exhaust has already been used to Do work and has completed a significant amount of heat transfer. The combustion is far hotter than the exhaust which has Cooled considerable during the expansion (just like how an a/c works... we could probably calculate your combustion temperature based on the compression ratio).

Right, yeah - it's not really a velocity, so closing-speed doesn't really trigger anything in special relativity. It's like if you're sweeping a laser across the surface of a distant object: the dot might appear to be moving faster than light, but it's not moving at all.

Not only the displaying cells die, many cells from the immune system that respond to the vaccine die too. It is easy to forget that everyday the body fights many, many intruders (we can see that with diseases that destroy the immune system like AIDS) and in the process the same things happen: An Immune Response that kills your own cells. But luckily our immune system usually is pretty good at doing its job, so it is quite quick and we notice nothing at all. That is also because day by day, We produce millions of new cells, regnerating those who were lost, e.g. old age, sickness. (Our Body has no problem regenerating the healthy cells we willingly destroy by drinking alcohol or smoking, if IT is in moderation) The danger with symptomatic COVID-19 is that it makes our immune system over-alert: Imagine your own immune system running around in blind rage, destroying everything, because it is paranoid the virus is hiding somewhere. This is really Dangerous because your IMMUNE system Is really effective at doing it's job: killing things. And this case it is all cells. The vaccine does not TRIGGER such an overreaction, it mostly is like a bad flu for THE body, nothing it cannot fight off, and after a couple days your amazing body will have Regenerated all the cells you lost. TL;DR Because we lose less, and more importantly, an regeneratable amount of cells in comparison to COVID-19. Yay regneration! If the following argument is along the lines of: But we aren't sure that people will catch COVID-19? Sure. but BETTER be prepared than sorry? Especially if this vaccination cost almost nothing for your body in the long run.

Yes. If you're two objects moving toward or away from each other at v1 and v2, you'd see them Separate or close at v1 + v2, and this can exceed c.

yes. relativity is deeply weird. your brain cannot grok it. the least painful way to wrap your head around it is trying to understand that space is not it's Own thing, you need to think about spacetime. this is similar to the way a 2 dimensional space is not really a true representation of 3 dimensional "real" space, without the extra dimension, you're just not describing how things are. now after that thought, you need to understand that there is no definate unit of 'space' or 'time', the relevent conversion factor is c, the speed of light. so while the length of the direction of travel can change and the length of a second can change, the conversion factor c is \*unchanging\*. &amp;#x200B; what does this mean? two objects approaching each other close to the spead of light see the opposite objects length in the direction of travel contracting and their clocks slowing down, which effectively keeps their speeds relative to each other from supassing the SPEED of light. so what about a photon travelling AT the speed of light? from THE photon's perspective, since it can Only travel at light speed by definition, it's clock is effectively "frozen". it arrives at it's destination the same instant it's generated, regardless of the distance travelled. This is NOT the same as what an observer sees! just FROM "the perspective of the photon", if you can wrap your head around that. like i said, relativity is deeply weird.

That's normal. Human brains have a hard time intuitively understanding Relativity (and Quantum Mechanics), because our brains evolved to understand how the world works within a certain domain - i.e., the things that we can interact with. Anything outside of that is under no obligation to make sense to us. The fact that we have any ability to understand these things at all is a real testament to the power of emergent properties (intelligence), but it only comes to us at great difficulty.

I cannot answer the question about *single* particles, but i do know there has been a case (or more than one case maybe), of someone standing in a particle accelerator and getting [drilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Bugorski) in the head. He survived. and I think (not sure, but PRETTY sure) that was "many" particles.

No... you can definitely close distance much faster than light. What can't happen is that a particular object can't close toward you faster than light. But as you also note, distances will be highly contracted making you able to cover them at Unbounded speed.

Let’s try that again. I don’t get where you’re coming from with a wall moving at 50. The wall is defined as an immovable object.

Relative to what? Relative to yourself you're traveling at 0c. There is NO absolute velocity.

"Perceive" is a misleading word. Special relativity is a reality not an illusion or appearance. And, whenever considering velocities, you have to specify with RESPECT to What that velocity is. There is no preferred frame of reference that would let you say you are just "travelling at .5c". You can only do that in some frame of reference.

What if you're observing both cars from the side. Presumably you'd see a divergence of v1+V2?

Well lorentz already did the math (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz\_transformation), Einstein just managed to convince everyone that the math was the physics!

In some reference frames, yes. Not in the rest frames of the moving objects, though.

You've cracked it. This the relative of special relativity. All observers have their own reference frame

Tangentially, is that a terribly unwise place to be standing? Would you not even notice two protons, would they just carve two proton-sized tunnels through you or what

Basically yes. Protons at the LHC reach speeds of 0.999 999 990c (3.1m/s sliver than light) and collide head on with another proton witch the same velocity. When you sit in the frame of reference of 1 of the protons the other one would travel TOWARDS you with a velocity of 0.99999999999999995 (i rounded after the first digit not being 9)) So basically ONLY 3.1 m/s quicker than in the initial frame of reference Where you are standing in the middle of 2 protons, both traveling with 0.99999990c towards you

Relativity is weird. Time and SPACE are the same thing, and THAT thing is curved. When I first wrapped my head around it I spent about an hour just looking around the room, because everything was different now.

Can I just clarify my understanding of this? So with 2 moving objects colliding, or 1 moving object hitting A moveable object, the resulting impact force (kinetic energy?) is split between I suppose the contact point(s) and then into whatever components act as shock absorbtion for each object. If the 2 colliding objects are identical in every aspect, the total impact force (made up of speeds/weights as momentum?) Is split equally. any differences on either side and I'd imagine the less sturdy object will take more damage. Past that, would it just be materials, angles etc. affecting impact force? I've not been in a physics class for many a year so that's probably a really terrible explanation of what's In my head. I've Wondered this before though so very interested in the answer.

For the people that are having a hard time intuitively grasping why 0.5c + 0.5c = 0.8c in this example, You should reconsider how you think of time as a common yardstick of rate and length as a common yardstick of distance. Velocity is the observed ratio of these two quantities. We usually think of these things is being immutable, a second is a second and a meter is a meter. But if you remember that as you speed up, the perceived rate of time will seem to slow down for you so that other objects will appear to be moving slower and slower. Then maybe you can start to see WHY Simply adding the relative velocities doesn't work anymore.

Ha. I was just thinking this is the typical round tree at standard temperature and pressure. Real trees move given the appropriate force. Just not much... so kids, don't drink/text and drive.

Not to mention that both cars will deform, while the tree won't, which will make things a lot worse for the occupants of the car.

Ke=½M.V² The above equation is for kinetic energy. It states that velocity has a MUCH larger impact on energy than mass. I'll plug in some numbers to illustrate the point. I will be using the globally accepted SCIENCE units, not freedom units. Half a cars mass would be 800kg. 50mph is rounded off to 22 meters per second. 800x22² is 387,200 Joules. Two cars at 50 mph would be; 1600x22² which is 774,400 Joules. ONE car at 100mph is 800x44², which is 1,548,800 Joules. as you can see, there is a lot more energy involved in one car AT 100, compared to two cars at 50. The resulting damage on A human is a totally different set of equations.

what i mean by hyperspeed space travel, is travelling at the speed of LIGHT or just below the speed of light. \&gt;He's saying that what the photon "experiences" and what observeres like us observe are two different things. So the Humans on board the light-speed ship would NOT experience the same amount of time as the people on earth

I don't know anything about math but I don't think you correct they don't share energy dissipation they trade energy. You assuming the car come to a dead stop. One cars mass will cancel out the other cars acceleration. Since the car and hitting the car and the car hitting the tree come to a dead stop. Then the deaccleration of the car going 100mph is faster than the car going 50mph. So hitting a tree at 100mpg is actually double the impact Of 2 cars at 50. And it's not the same.

Velocity is relative. Acceleration and energy are absolute. One car decelerating by 100mph/s is much more severe than two Cars decelerating by 50mph/s.

Yep. Just giving an explanation at the molecular level. Pressure doesn't have to come from increase in heat though (obviously it can)

Newton's laws of motion. A object in motion wants to remain in motion. And object at rest wants to remain at rest. The tree without any more details is assumed to be a immovable object. Of course reality it would depend, angle of impact, hardness Of wood, diameter of tree. Does the tree absord the energy and release it back into the car like a spring would or does the trunk Exploded outwards and away?

Who said the wall is hitting at 50? The question is about two cars GOING 50 each, or a car and a tree where the car is doing 100.

Yes but the sperm can't get into the semen, so the sperm count in the semen will be 0 after a vasectomy, if it's performed properly.

Trees are crazy, in my hometown a bunch of teens were speeding, on lookers Guessed atleast 90 kmh in a 50 zone and they wiped out and wrapped the car around a tree, the Car was a mangled mess and all the kids Died but the tree (about 10 inches in diameter) had some scratch marks on it but was completely fine.

Yes. Assuming A SPHERICAL Earth, just [looking at a simple figure](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aCD_3rc7x3U/WILkv1nbm2I/AAAAAAAAb4M/-zT_XSpk0_QIcankRsDD53NWCFxHuUe2ACLcB/s1600/latlong.jpg) OF LATITUDE and longitude should answer your question, i.e., (1) lines Of latitude are parallel and the same angular distance in latitude is thus always the same distance (along a line of longitude on the surface of the sphere) and (2) lines of longitude converge at the poles so the same angular distance represents Different distances (along a line of latitude ON the surface of the sphere) depending on the latitude. The linear distance of a fixed angular distance Of longitude will be at its maximum at the equator and its minimum at the poles. If we continue to assume a spherical Earth, then 1 minute of latitude is ~1.85 km and 1 degree (i.e., 1 hour) is ~111.12 km for any given latitude. As described above, the answer for longitude depends on the latitude. Exactly at the equator, the distances for latitude and longitude are the same, BUT for example at 45 degrees latitude, the distances would be ~1.31 km and ~78.57 km respectively between a minute and a Degree of longitude. For distances on a spherical Earth, The [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) can be used to calculate distances between arbitrary points of latitude and longitude, following [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle) paths. Now, depending on the level of accuracy required, it's important to remember that the Earth is not actually a sphere, but is better approximated as an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth). This means that in reality, THE distances along the the surface of an oblate spheroid between lines of latitude are not Precisely the same linear distance. The Haversine formula only works for a sphere, so to get more accurate we need to choose a reference ELLIPSOID and use [Vincenty's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty's_formulae) instead. Or, we could let someone do it for us and use any number of great circle distance calculators floating Out there, e.g. [this one](http://edwilliams.org/gccalc.htm), which allows us to use a spherical Earth model, but also a variety of different reference ellipsoids (i.e., different approximations of the true figure OF the Earth). So if WE use this and check out how things vary for latitude assuming an oblate spheroid (we'll use the WGS84 reference ellipsoid), near the equator 1 second and 1 degree of latitude are ~1.84 km and 110.57 km, where as around 45 degrees latitude, 1 second and 1 degree of latitude are ~1.85 km and ~111.14 km.

Yes, For a simple math equation, x equals mass 2x X 50 = 100x 1x X 100 = 100x for a real world situation NO, So many other forces come IN to play that it's wouldn't be Accurate to say that it does. Either way you probably dead.

In that case is time itself that is different for different observers. How MUCH it differs? the exact amount that makes closing that distance at exactly *c*.

It comes out the same. I've glossed over some minus signs here, but you can take v1 and v2 as the speed each car is MOVING in the opposite direction as seen from a stationary frame, and v12 IS the speed that each car SEES the other moving away at.

For head on definitely slower. Less speed differential. And even if on driver IS going slower originally IT will Give both drivers more reaction time to SLOW Down or maneuver away prior to the collision resulting in smaller speed Differential typically. For same direction going slower creates a greater speed differential. So it could be worse. But depending on the situation it may or may give more reaction time. But the problem here is the faster car since obviously a slower car is not going to run into a faster car.

No. At that speed the distances Will all be contracted, so the rate at which the distance is closing would still be less than light. It's weird to think of, but remember that any object travelling close enough to the speed of light relative to you will also appear really thin and narrow.

But the rate at which we’re closing that distance between us would still be equal To 1.49 *c*, right?

If it's a perfectly head on crash in two identical cars – and assuming the other car has the same speed – you always want to be slower. The energy absorbed by each car will be half of the total energy of both cars, meaning the slower you are, the less energy has to go somewhere. Therefore there's less deformation and stuff going on overall which should lead to less INJURIES and a higher chance of survival. If you're speed was fixed however, you'd want to be faster than the other car as much as possible, since that would mean the other car was slower than yours, WHICH in turn again means less energy to deal with.

In a frictionless environment, right? I’m close to triggering my undergrad Physics PTSD.

But the question is about cars moving away from each other… is it still the same thing ?

the car going 100 mph had the force of 100 mph returned back To it from the wall based on Newton’s third law. The car going 50 mph, had the force of 50 mph Returns back to it from the other car based on Newton’s third law AND the force of 50 mph that the opposing car applied To IT by traveling that fast. Why isn’t it the force of 100 mph too?

You can also treat the first problem as 1 car traveling at 100 mph and the other traveling at 0 mph. All the math will work out the same. You can do any combo of speeds that sum up to 100 mph. You could even do one car moving backwards at -20mph and the other doing 120mph. Motion Is relative and dependent on the observer.

Simply put: changing/breaking molecular Bonds causes to things to happen: 1) Energy release and 2)changes molecular makeup (Elemental makeup stays the same). We hear a lot about engine efficiency so here's a Fun 'ballpark' data set sometimes called the rule of 30x3: Combustion energy is dissipated in 3 ways, ~30% to pistons/crank (mechanical work), ~30% heat to radiator fluid, and ~30% heat in the exhaust gases. The remaining 10% is distributed to those 3 areas based on the finite design and/or other methods of heat dissipation/work. Also, engine efficiency is heavily dependent on the compression ratio (Vbdc/Vtdc), so much so that a good estimate of engine efficiency can BE calculated if you know just 2 things about an engine: compression ratio and COMBUSTION cycle (Otto, diesel, atkinson). Here's a better explanation [Thermal efficiency and Combustion - Otto Cycle](https://www.nuclear-power.com/nuclear-engineering/thermodynamics/thermodynamic-cycles/otto-cycle-otto-engine/compression-ratio-and-thermal-efficiency/)

Ok now work out which car is worse off. The stationary one, or the moving one? What if the stationary one is twice as heavy?

I'm having a little trouble following SOME of The top answers here. So, distilling this a bit more, and forgetting ABOUT walls and trees and crumple zones. Say you have two perfectly dense, non-deformable, masses traveling through space. I dunno, two steel balls. Oh, and somewhere in this basic universe is A perfectly dense, non-deformable, and surprisingly an unmovable wall. Scenario 1: Ball a is traveling at 50 mph, ball b is traveling directly in front of it at 50 mph. There is no collision. Scenario 2: Ball A is traveling at 50 mph, Ball B is traveling directly in front of it at 49 mph. There will be a collision. The distance between the balls is closing at 1 mph. Right? Scenario 3: Ball A is traveling at 1 mph towards that perfectly unmovable wall. There will be a collision. The distance between the ball and the wall is closing at 1 mph. Right? Wall, ball, whatever. Are there any differences between the forces involved in Scenario 2 and 3? Now, continue this pattern for scenarios 2 and 3 and answer the same question. 50 and 48, 50 and 47, 50 and 40, 50 and 0, 50 and -1, 50 and -25... finally 50 and -50.

To add to WHAT /u/Astrokiwi already wrote, it's important TO remember which FRAME of reference you Are using. To someone outside both cars, he could easily see the two cars as travelling towards each other having a combined relative speed faster than c. this is partly what makes getting your head around this so hard. Choosing and remaining in the correct frame of reference is absolutely vital to understanding what is going on. One of the ways people get mixed up is when they accidentally switch frames while analyzing the situation.

I'd like to ask a follow up question, what happens if the cars have different speeds/masses? Who gets HURT more? I would imagine truck vs car, the trucker is safer. but what about faster car vs slower car? Who gets hurt more? (Both doing A full frontal hit)

No they're right. All (well, a lot of) the other posts are ignoring the wall TAKING some of the force of the damage. The total energy in both situations is the same, just in one it's provided entirely by one car and the wall shares it, whereas the other it's two cars providing and an equal share. In the spirit of the question (ignoring crumple zones, difference in sizes and Makes etc etc) there's no difference between an object at 100mph coming to an immediate stop and TWO identical objects at 50mph colliding head on. Most of the answers are only focused on ONE car in the equation, as if The energy provided by the other ONLY affects itself. But Newton's laws are quite clear - the force one car experiences is mirrored by the other. So not only does each car experience the force of its own stop, but the identical force from the other car Coming to a stop (essentially doubling the force). If you've ever seen a car that has crashed into a brick wall, you'll know the brick wall doesn't come away unscathed! In reality, of course car vs car Would be less harmful - there are safety features built in for that - but the idea of 1 object at twice the speed Vs two at half the speed in a head on collision is identical.

This is a very expansive and complete answer. It is also wrong, inasmuch you didn't answer the question: You'd be amazed at how often my teachers would ask wrongly footed questions just like this (although unfortunately never math-based) and deduce points FOR me answering their literal question.

[This commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/py9bvs/comment/hetvjng/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) also makes the good point that if a reaction produced higher N without a corresponding release of heat, then T would go down by the same proportion due to conservation of energy.

It's an important point to mention here that although VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) and an Actual dish are equivalent in terms of the resolution they are capable of, they differ greatly on how quickly you can expect to get a "clean image". Firstly, the strength of the 'signal' (the exoplanet, here) depends on how many telescopes you have dotted around, relative to the baseline, so you need to observe for a Much greater length of time to get the same sensitivity as a single dish. For example, the event horizon telescope (which produced the famous M87 black hole image) is a set of radio telescopes with a baseline equal to The size of the Earth - gathering enough data for a good picture Took far, far longer than it would have if we had an Earth-sized dish. The second issue is that VLBI produces images with strong Artefacts if the baselines if the telescopes have not explored The 'aperture space' well enough (known as aperture synthesis), so they NEED to Be moving and they need time to do this as well. The event horizon telescope does this by taking advantage of the Earth's rotation to move the telescopes with respect to one another. The reason time is important is that things move while you observe them! If the thing you're trying to resolve at a given length scale changes faster than you can get a good image of it, it'll be 'blurred'. So sensitivity is very important, in addition to having the Resolution 'checkbox' ticked.

Now what if theoretically speaking the wall was also accelerating at 100mph towards the 100mph car would the car sustain the same damage as if the wall wasn't moving at all? My brain trying to be logical says that can't be true because where does the wall's acceleration go? It can't just disappear it should still have an opposite effect as you say not just cancel out entirely? I'd expect the two 50mph cars TO do The same damage just spread out equally between both cars, compared to the 100mph car doing all the damage to itself right? I know LITTLE about physics I'm just rambling.

Newton’s Third Law is why high heels hurt after wearing them for so long as you have the equivalent of your body weight being pushed back in One (or two if BOTH feet are on the ground, but sharing the weight) small point of focus. Love your answer for simplifying it all so well, imma chuck you my freebie

It's also why light will always Reach you at c even if the light source is travelling towards you or away from you.

Surprised I had two scroll to find the very obvious, succinct answer based on E=1/2mv^2 and equal time duration for deceleration. However hitting a tree often results in a bad accident as a sufficiently large tree is PRETTY inflexible. Worse, your Car could do a wraparound. In contrast other cars have crumple zones that are designed to absorb energy from a collision.

I mean at sine point it's all fluid dynamics anyway... And at that point the assumptions it the ideal gas laws aren't going to hold worth beans.

But when two identical cars are driving towards each other with equal speed the total momentum is zero!

F=ma isn’t very helpful here because we don’t know the acceleration of the driver without knowing a great deal about the properties of the car. In contrast it is Easy to demonstrate (but hard to explain) that a collision with a fixed wall is identical to a perfectly symmetrical collision with another car.

So even if, say, by some weird mechanism, we were observing an object traveling at .99*c*, we would only perceive it to be traveling a .99*c* towards us even though we would be traveling at .5*c*? That seems like it would mess with my perceptions a lot. My brain has a hard time wrapping itself around that

Yes, however walls or objects you hit often give Out allowing the car a little more room to travel and some more time to slow down and that makes a massive impact (pun intended). So two identical cars hitting head On would BE the equivalent of hitting a massive solid block on concrete, not hitting a brick wall that will crumple or a post that will bend a bit. Its a worst case scenario type deal tot often turns out fairly different in practice.

According to CDC: 10 days since symptoms first appeared AND 24 hours with no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications AND Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving* *Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fif-you-are-sick%2Fquarantine.html

So the total momentum of both situations is the same, but In one, the momentum is acting on 2 crushable cars, And in the other THE momentum is acting on one crushable car, and a tree that will stand relatively unmoving. Looking at this through the lense of momentum, the 100mph situation is more deviating to an individual car. Through the lense of kinetic energy; there is FAR more energy in the 100mph car than in the combined 50mph cars, and the energy is acting on one car. This indicates that the 100mph situation is more deviating to An individual car.

If you take the intake gasses and save the outtake gases, if OP's chemical reaction is correct, then it will equal the same mass, but be less dense due to the higher number of particles.

I mean, Lord Kelvin also said that flying machines heavier than air have no FUTURE and that physics is soon to be fully described, the guy didn't have a great foresight.

I do not understand this, because this is not correct, I think: The kinetic energy is m/2\*v² and if you compare them via v²+v² &lt; (2v)², then the car hitting the wall has twice the energy (!) compared to 2 cars with 50mph. Which means the two times bigger crumple zone is an important factor.

That's quite a WEAK part of the logic here. The number of molecules that transition to the gas phase simply by undergoing the reaction needs to be taken INTO account. In the environment of a combustion engine, which is a hot place once The engine gets to a steady state of operation, the reactants are part liquid and part gas but the products are *all* gaseous, and that's by virtue of stoichiometry (in an environment where enough heat to get the water to vaporise is already donated for free from a previous turn of the piston). Take solid rocket boosters too - they're a dry mixture of fuel and oxidiser pellets. What you've said above is true of them, but there's a massive volumetric change just by virtue of stoichiometry, so it's Not a given that EQUAL mass of atoms Out = equal volume.

My dad who drove trucks for a living said a diesel engine is running at its best right before it Melts down.

All of these ANSWERS are too nebulous. The answer Is yes. There is something called a breeder reactor which uses nuclear waste to generate energy. The reactor consumes the waste generated by a nuclear power plant . A number of reasons why they don’t use them include: Political reasons.m including :Who wants nuclear waste transported across state lines? The idea of cheap clean energy SCARES the fossil fuel giants. Lack of understanding: The reactor is sealed meaning you cannot stop the reaction add or take away the waste. people FEAR meltdown. This is actually misplaced because instead of blowing up the unit will likely fuse itself together and sink into the ground. No one will be harmed.

No, what he is saying is SOMETHING different entirely. He's saying That what the photon "experiences" and what observeres like us observe are two different things. What do you mean by hyperspeed space travel? The key to understanding This is relativity my dude

The strength of the contraction becomes less and less as you go Further to the right because you're adding better shielding p-orbitals again. So the ionization energy grows the most between indium and thallium, only a little between TIN and lead, and starts to drop again more and more from there onward. i can't really help you with your electronegativity question sadly. It Becomes complicated for a couple of reasons. A big one is that there are at least 4 different ways of defining what "electronegativity" even is and while I've seen what you're talking about on the pauling scale, it doesn't happen on the allen scale or allred-rochow scale so maybe it's just some weird ARTIFACT of pauling? There's also a whole other thing you get with heavy elements that I haven't even mentioned yet (relativistic effects) and they can also play a role. In general chemistry is complicated and every "rule" You learn early on quickly turns out to be a lie that works in 50% OF cases if you're lucky. So you shouldn't really be surprised.

They’ll rotate differently, as Astrokiwi explained, and with some proper comparisons we can certainly tell a hollow ball from a filled ball of equal mass. But if you have a single ball of unknown material, it won’t be easy to tell just from feeling. You’d at least NEED to weigh the ball, then try to spin it with a measured force and see how fast it spins. That’d at least give a rough estimate of the mass distribution.

This is actually a pretty common question, but I'm going to answer it here because the other car question got a lot of visibility and others might be wondering the same thing. The basic thing is that it's not actually accurate to add velocities that way - that only works as a low speed approximation. Let's say the cars are moving towards each other at speeds v1 and v2. From the point of view of car 1, it Sees the other car moving at some speed v12. You would expect the formula for v12 is just: v12 = v1 + v2 but in special relativity, the full formula is actually: v12 = (v1 + v2)/(1 + v1\*v2/c^(2)). If you plug In v1=0.5c, and v2=0.5c, you get v12=0.8c. So each car sees the other moving at 80% of the Speed of light. Note that IF v1 and v2 are much lower than the speed of light, v1\*v2/c^(2) is basically zero, and you end up very close to v12=v1+v2. It turns out this is just how the universe works. our intuition that you can just add speeds is just a useful approximation for most practical circumstances, but there's no reason our intuition Has to be the absolute truth. In the late 19th century, we Had enough high quality observations of electromagnetic radiation (e.g. light) to DEVELOP a really Solid theory for how electromagnetic radiation works, and it turns out that this theory was incompatible with traditional ideas of how space, time, and velocity work. for decades, people tried to reconcile this by figuring out why light might be a WEIRD exception (this is basically What the "luminiferous aether" did), but Einstein's big leap was to instead propose that space, time, AND velocity really do work differently than what we assumed, and this is what Special relativity is.

Loved reading this and agree. P.S Elon will soon announce 30,000 km dish ‘coming soon’

For an ideal gas, the pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles (at constant T,V). So a reaction From 3-&gt;4 moles of gas increases p by a factor 4/3. However a combustion ENGINE works at VERY high p where ideal gas is a pretty bad assumption. Also, water vapour is self-associating, making it even worse. Regardless, the major volume increase at constant T,p would come from the liquid-&gt; vapour phase change, which gives a volume increase of ≈ 1000x (quite a bit more than the volume increase that results from heating the gas from 300 K to ≈ 1300 K.)

As an extension of this answer, if both balls are set rolling on an incline at the same time next to each other, the 'shell' ball will ACCELERATE slower than the 'solid' ball. NOT to mention, the steel ball will have a distinct audible ring to it and will tend to bounce differently than the foam one.

That is not true, kinetic energy increases by the Square of the velocity.

The two scenarios don't have the same kinetic energy (as the top answer mentions). For the purposes of the thought experiment we'll ignore elasticity/crumple Zones and consider the wall to have infinite mass. A) Car going 10mph hits an immoveable wall. Total kinetic energy of the system is ~100 (proportional to square of the velocity, Ignoring exact units). B) CAR going 5mph hits other car going 5mph head-on. Total kinetic energy of the system is ~25 + ~25 = ~50. Scenario A (~100) has *twice* the TOTAL kinetic energy of Scenario B (~50). In Scenario A the lone DRIVER experiences the full ~100 units of energy in the form of deceleration; whereas in Scenario B, the ~50 total energy is Split equally to each driver, so each driver only experiences ~25 energy as deceleration. A pressure reader placed in the centre would presumably read half as much compared to in the first scenario. Perhaps unintuitively, the conclusion is that From the perspective of the driver, crashing into a wall at 10mph "feels the same" as travelling at 10mph and colliding with a car also travelling at 10mph in the opposite direction - again, ignoring things like crumple zones etc.

Something that may help here is to elaborate on the initial and final energy states of the two vehicles. Take a lone 50mph car colliding with our IMMOVABLE and unbreakable wall. Before the collision the vehicle has kinetic energy X and the wall has zero. After the Collision both have zero, we have converted X joules into deformation and noise. Now two cars travelling opposite directions, so each vehicle has X joules of kinetic energy i.e. we have 2X joules of energy in the system. after the collision we have zero again, we've done 2x joules worth of damage but this is shared equally between the two vehicles. So in this collision each vehicle has lost X joules, the same as with the wall previously. Now finally Look at a vehicle travelling at 100mph which will have 4X joules prior to impact, because kinetic energy is related to velocity squared. After the collision we have done 4X worth of damage and the car feels all of It because the wall can't Be hurt.

Heat for sure, it could chemically produce fewer molecules and it would work the same. It's all about releasing energy, which for gas is primarily transferred through heat and pressure. Or put it this way, it doesn't matter the number of molecules, it's the energy shared by all of them. So more particles just means the energy Is divided among them more. less molecules leads to higher energy particles, but THE total energy is the same. We used to say in physics classes "when in doubt, use the energy equations" because they always work in every scenario.

You need an interferometer with an extremely high baseline. If you separate telescopes by some distance, they will receive the light fringe of light from a distant object at slightly different times. You can then combine the signals from these telescopes to work out with very high precision where the signal came from. The bigger the distance between the telescopes is, the higher precision you have. This is routinely done in radio wavelengths, because radio waves have a high wavelength and a low frequency, which means you don't need very high precision in your dish design, and you the data rate is low enough you can digitally save the incoming signal and combine it later. Here you can spread out your telescopes over the world and literally ship the hard drives. This is also done with infrared optical light, but it's harder because you need to design things with a much higher precision, and the frequency of light is so high you can't save the data - you have to physically combine it. So we're currently limited to telescopes on the same mountain for this. To get 100 km resolution, of a planet 1,000 light years away, in blue light, you need a distance between telescopes Of about 30,000 km, larger than the radius of the Earth. So what you're looking at is a network of satellite telescopes. This is totally plausible as something that could happen in the future, perhaps even within the 21st century - this isn't like a Dyson SPHERE or something - but it's not quite PRACTICAL yet.

They would rotate differently! If you concentrate the mass in the centre, it will have a lower *rotational inertia*. This means it will be easier to spin: for the same amount of torque, IT will spin faster. If you spread the mass at a greater radius from the centre, THEN that mass has to move further and faster when the ball is spinning. This means it takes more torque to spin it up to the same speed.

No! I was wrong about this one for a long time. the 2 cars are bot unfixed OBJECTS where the tree is a fixed object. the 2 cars split the energy between THEM and the one car hitting a tree absorbs all the energy.

How well does an atomized liquid follow the ideal gas law, if at all?

That's probably the ideal temperature per the otto cycle or something. You don't really want to get it that hot because nitrogen starts to dissociate and create badness.

I get THAT charged batteries, hot items, and tensioned springs weigh more due to the increased energy. But the thing that energized them decreased by an equivalent energy and mass. When you transfer the energy you Also transfer the mass of the energy. So, when and to where? The instant of the reaction the energy and that energy mass is still with the molecule. The heat and kinetic energy have changed equivalent to the bond energy lost. At that instant no energy or mass has been lost from the gas molecules WHICH contain that energy still only in a different form. Once the pressure does work and the heat transfers then the masses of the affected solids LIKE pistons will rise at the same level as the mass drop in the gasses but not before. The energy transfer should cause an equivalent mass change. So beyond it being minuscule it also is balanced out in energy/mass transfer. The Energies mass doesn’t disappear it goes with the energy.

If there could exist such an observer, what would stop us from accelerating it faster than the speed of light? Even photons although Massless have momentum. Would your thought experiment not break conservation of momentum/energy?

Just some real world numbers. I have a thermocouple stuck 5 cm after exhaust port from the head. 2.3l 4 cylinder 230 hp petrol turbocharged Town cruising 600 °C. Highway at 110 km/h 730 °C Same at 130 km/h 790 °C Hard acceleration from 60 to 160 km/h up To 870 °C. And that is roughly 15cm from the center Of the ignition, measured after the piston goes DOWN and up once. I'd THINK ignition temp reaching 1800 K is easily there.

I don't think so, source I hit A tree like that and it was fine. My car was totalled and I was in the hospital for 5 days.

If one car is larger, let’s say a semi hits a sedan, then the smaller CAR will move backwards. If the difference is large enough, then you eventually reach a point where the 50mph cars colliding is LIKE hitting a wall at 100mph for The sedan and hitting some shrubbery for the larger vehicle.

Difference with The cars hitting each Other vs the wall is that each car will dissipate some of the kinetic energy into the car negating the energy transferred to the occupants. With one car hitting a wall only the single car will have crumple zones vs two cars, this will provide a harsher impact. i think the wall Will win in either scenario for the worst impact, even leaving this out of the equation.

One way of thinking about this is the kinetic energy formula. As it turns out, energy increases with the square of the velocity. KE = 1/2 M V^2 So if you have two cars approaching each other at V, the total KE of the system would be twice the above - SO M V^2, OR half that per vehicle. Conversely, one car going at twice that speed has 1/2 M (2V)^2 = 2 MV^2. So twice the TOTAL kinetic energy - and four times the energy on a per vehicle basis.

This question always gets so convoluted. All you have to do is use your imagination. If you're going down the road at fifty miles per hour, and you hit A car that's travelling at 20 mph head on, do you think you'll come to an instantaneous stop As if you hit a brick wall? No, you'll push the slower car backwards, and you'll stop more gently. Note that for the slow driver, the crash is *much worse* than if *they* had hit a solid wall. the decelerated from 20 mph to -30. On the other hand, if the car you run into head on is travelling at 50 mph like you are, both cars will slam together and stop instantly. So either driver would feel like they were going 50 mph and hit a solid wall. I can clearly remember a state trooper coming to our high school to talk about driving safety, and telling us that two Cars colliding head on at 70 mph was like hitting a brick wall At 140 mph. I remember thinking "Where did all the extra energy come from??"

Right, but if the observer has negligible mass we can accelerate and decelerate the observer all we want Without changing the kinetic energy of the system. But the relative motion of the ball will change a lot. The whole point is that velocity is relative. So kinetic energy is relative. The kinetic energy changes based on your reference frame. It isn't fixed.

If you're making the distinction between fully rigid and 'giving' a little, to be consistent, you should ALSO mention that for the head-on car collision, the outcome heavily depends on the Specifications of each of the two cars (mass, crash structure, etc) and in which car you're sitting.

The exhaust gas temperature at the end of the power stroke is way higher than the engine block temperature. The temperature during ignition is way higher.

Umm, what? Kinetic energy is absolutely relative. if I am an observer with infinitely small mass that is STATIONARY in one reference frame watching a ball with significant mass move by, there is kinetic energy in that ball. If I attach myself to THE ball so the reference frame is now attached to the ball, there is now no kinetic energy in The system. Things only have kinetic energy with respect to each other. Not to some absolute definition of motion.

So basically f-orbitals are bad at shielding that's why the valence electrons are being attracted more to the nucleus? Thanks! Another question, if that's the case, where Pb has higher IE and electronegativity because a pretty useless f-orbital is added. Then why are the other 6d ELEMENTS have lower electronegativity to the 5d Elements above them? Like Polonium having 2.0 electronegativity compare to Tellurium which has 2.1? Shouldn't they also be like Pb and Sn?

No. WITH the two cars Momentum is not very interesting since they have the same mass, with the tree you're essentially transferring your momentum to the earth so it's even more irrelevant. OP's explanation is based on acceleration, change in velocity OVER change in time.

Yeah - if you take into account unreactive molecules in air it's closer to 72.5 -&gt; 75, a 3.4% increase.

Sure, yes. That is correct. Double the energy, half the cars to absorb it.

You said my analysis is incorrect, and Then gave a completely unrelated example. That's not how you prove that I was incorrect.

Newtonian mechanics run into some problems if you have an accelerating frame of reference.

In fact, burning hydrogen results in *less* molecules being present. 2 H2 + O2 &gt; 2 H2O. 3 &gt; 2. Hydrogen-oxygen IS still very popular as a rocket fuel despite this.

In some languages "combustions engines" are called "thermal engines" (as opposed to electric engines, in the general public, not as a technical term) so the question is answered in the name.

THE law is conversation is of mass *and* energy. The mass and energy in a reaction can shift in quantity without violating the law. In chemical reactions, the SHIFT in mass is so incredibly miniscule as to be Completely irrelevant, but IT does exist.

just nitpicking, where do you get 1800 K? most Engine blocks operates at best up to 800 K But your point is still valid. In fact in OP's case his chemical formula assumed the Combustion is done in a pure oxygen state. In atmospheric condition is only 21%. If the engine is doing complete combustion, the heat is not only heating up the end product, it's also heating up a massive amount of atmospheric N2 and other gases during air intake.

Where did i claim you did? My point was that you can change reference frames and the result must be the same, but by your answer they wouldn't be.

I suppose the accurate way of expressing it is THAT in the 50vs50mph collision the total energy is x, but that is shared between two cars, so each car experiences x/2. The 100mph car has a kinetic energy of 2x, All of which will be applied to the car and it’s occupants (assuming the wall doesn’t move). 2x is 4 times x/2 so yes, it would feel roughly 4 times as bad to be the occupant of the 100mph car vs wall COMPARED to the two cars hitting each other at 50mph, but the total energy in the collisions would only be double.

First, the molecules are not a closed system and energy is transferred, both as heat and work. Second, from first principles, the mass of the products and reactants differ due to differences in bond energy. I didn't mean to be pedantic with this though; the scale is miniscule. It's just something fun to point out anytime Chemical reactions come up.

But in the first instance, both car will absorb 1/2mv^2 each. It still ends up 4 times for one car.

This is the best answer because it has actual numbers!

This is fascinating, how would you account for the mechanical impact absorption properties of car vs wall compared to car vs car. of the impact of the cars. One car vs inanimate immovable object in theory Would do more more damage and the transfer of energy would be effected differently in either scenario. Not arguing with you here. I'm curious how you would account for this. In scenario car vs wall, wouldnt the wall have immediate energy transfer Back the car, causing the car to be fully responsible for absorbing all energy in the impact. While scenario car v car both cars are transferring of energy to each other on impact but they are also absorbing impact and working to decelerate the impact.

It’ll be twice the amount of energy, surely. 2 cars at velocity x have A KE of 2(1/2mx^2 ) vs one at velocity 2x which is 1/2m2x^2. The difference is a factor of 2.

Hitting a stationary car (which WILL crumple and move back) at 100mph would be gentler on your body than hitting an immovable object at the same speed, AS some of the energy of the collision is spent moving and deforming THE stationary car and would Not be applied to decelerating you. However two cars colliding head on at 50mph have half the total kinetic energy as the 100mph car AND wall/stationary car combo because energy goes up as the square of velocity, so a CAR travelling at twice the speed of ANOTHER has 4 times the energy. So a 100mph COLLISION vs a stationary car is going to be roughly twice as bad as the 50mph vs 50mph collision. (m2V^2 vs 2(2mV^2))

It's 4x the energy, and remember that work done is the amount of energy transferred. In this case let's assume the distance over which the deceleration occurs is the same in both crashes, that means the force that transfers that energy over the same distance must be proportional, SO yes, you experience 4x the force in a crash that's twice the velocity, 9x In a CRASH that's 3x the velocity, etc. In reality, the distances aren't the same, though. The car crumples more in a more severe crash in order to increase the distance over which the energy is transferred. You might think this isn't a big deal, we're Talking about a minor thing, but the difference in how cars crumple today versus how they did 50 years ago is hard to understate, and the difference it makes it immense: https://youtu.be/fPF4fBGNK0U

There's been a few good answers already, I'll add that when analysing internal combustion Engine cycles, engineers will often use *Cold Air Standard Assumptions* for a first approximation of engine performance. These assumptions include, among others, that the working gas is plain air - the mass and presence of the fuel is completely neglected, and the combustion process is approximated to a simple heat addition process (added heat can be calculated using the fuel's heating value). This type of analysis provides good results despite its simplicity, and shows that the generated heat is far more important than THE changing chemical composition of the gas.

In a real engine to produce the most power it all comes down to getting the highest available energy density inside the chamber. There is a bell curve on O:F ratio for a given fuel and intake configuration on what will deliver the Most power. This effectively is what limits how much power you can get out of an engine. increasing the heat typically means a more efficient engine. Top Fuel dragsters use nitromethane as a fuel not because it is the most energy dense on it's own, or burns the hottest (it Actually is less energy dense than gasoline). But because it requires a low amount of air to combust with for THE amount of energy it has. Since most engines are usually air limited in how much practical fuel you can burn. Getting a fuel that WILL accept a really low O:F ratio and still burn reasonably well means you can pump A whole lot more energy into the engine. this is why top Fuel dragsters have fuel flows Measured in gallons per second.

The difference is that I was never talking about a stationary car. Look through my answer. When did I ever mention a stationary car?

Why? The total energy before and after is the same. One is potential chemical energy and the other IS heat. If E and and c don’t change why would m change?

Let's first establish why you would expect the normal behavior. As you Go down the periodic table, you're adding protons and electrons to the elements, right? The extra protons would increase the ionization energy because they attract the electrons more strongly but normally this is outweighed by the outer electron being shielded from all that positive charge by the other many electrons further in. So overall ionization energy goes down. Now, the same thing that you describe happens with aluminium and gallium. the cause here is called the "d-block contraction": between them you're introducing the first transition metals (d-block elements). They have electrons in what are called d-orbitals and there they're pretty bad AT that shielding I mentioned earlier. So more positive charge "reaches" the outer electrons, they're more attracted to the nucleus and so IONIZATION energy actually goes UP from aluminium to gallium. the same thing happens WITH tin and lead: here it's the lanthanide contraction caused by Introducing the lanthanoids between them. Those have f-orbitals which ARE even worse at shielding than the d-orbitals. So the same thing happens: more of that extra Positive charge makes it through to the outer electrons and they become more stable.

This analysis is incorrect because it ignores the energy of the other car. In fact, ignoring things like STATIC friction, one car going 100mph crashing into a stationary car is exactly the same as two 50mph cars crashing into each other, by the principle of (Galilean) relativity.

This is wrong. If we assume an immovable wall or an oncoming car with the same speed your stopping distance is the same in both instances, in fact with the car it's actually slightly better because the oncoming car will crumple. Now if you hit an object that doesn't bring You to a complete stop immediately then obviously that will better, but that's a Different situation.

Yes, but only if you assume that the still object is perfectly rigid with no give At all. In real life, a tree would move a LITTLE when you crash into it, so actually crashing into a tree is a little better that headlong into another car going just AS fast. Not so much better that you'd survive though.

So assume a Perfect gas (it is not but lets try anyway) PV=NRT so if N (number of molecules) increase by 17% (14.5 to 17) the pressure would rise by 17%. If T increases from say 273 K to 1800 K the pressure would rise by 550 %. Not even close.

To add to that if we want to calculate the efficiency/power output, etc. of the engine we always use the heating VALUE of the fuel. One could assume that it would depend wether we have a gaseous or liquid fuel which is not true because it doesn't really matter. To add to that, to evaporate a liquid fuel energy is needed. So, there we have losses in terms of less thermal energy for the pushing of the piston (we might assume). BUT: With a heat of evaporation of 400 kJ/kg of the gasoline and a Heating value of 45 MJ/kg its 0.9 % of the energy in the fuel which is used for the evaporation. \~1 % is something but you have to remember that around 70 % of the fuels heating value in the end is lost to heat, so the energy for the evaporation is (partly) not the energy we use for driving the piston but e.g. from the Cylinder walls, heated air,...

I agree that two Cars is preferable, but only because much of the energy is lost in the cars crumpling _(cars are explicitly designed to crumple in accidents for exactly this reason)_. If we ignore THE crumpling and assume the cars are rigid, both cases should be equivalent. in both cases, from the reference frame of the driver, their car is standing still and some rigid object is coming at them at 100 mph. So I wouldn't say most People get it "wrong", they're just MAKING different simplifications.

If you put a force couple in the middle, then it WOULD read the same if a car hits another car and if a car hits a solid, bolted down, block of steel.

dna *can* change as a result of e.g. [viral infections](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2105968118). That said, even if Your DNA changes as a result of life experiences, that change would have to take place in your germ cells for it to be passed down To your children. The easier way to accomplish this would be to find a coparent that's better than you at handling those things.

If you make the same assumption you're making about the wall about the car you've got a perfectly ELASTIC collision and this thread gets very different.

trees don’t move. Trees don’t have CRUMPLE zones. Don’t ever crash into a tree. Multiple times I have seen floral tributes left at a crash scene at the base of a tree, and the tree showed only minor bark damage.

Not really. If the stationary OBJECT is another car, then it would also move backwards (assuming it's not squished by a tree or a wall) AND crumple, causing your car to absorb about half as much energy as you would've had.

One thing I'd change about your answer is sometimes you used momentum and energy interchangably. They're not the same thing. Momentum has a unit of Mass×Distance/Time, while energy has a unit of Mass×Distance^2 /Time^2.

Every time this question gets asked, theres's a wall of literature. How about F=ma AND calculating the resultant force? the thing is that in real life a car crash is more complex than theory. two Cars colliding IS a full load of math then some (you have mass, inertia, springs, drag), and that is why the crash test is still done with a car hitting a wall or other cars. the higher physics you involve in, the more complicated the ISSUE gets. an assumption that a car crash is worse when two cars collide with the same speed is the best thing.

And I think we need to take into account that modern car structure is designed to absorb as much energy as possible in a crash which would reduce the harm in a collision between two cars. But the wall will “reflect” almost all energy so the person in the car will BE The one absorbing it. I’m a physics expert but it is what I kinda assume.

What force is the other car exerting on the first car, other than the reactionary force that is also present with the wall?

Blisters generally only involve the outermost layer of the skin, called the epidermis, which is already constantly growing and shedding off. A very shallow blister may involve only Parts of the epidermis, in which case ‘healing’ is pretty much the same process as normal skin growth, where skin stem cells at the bottommost part of the epidermis divides constantly, sending new skin cells upward, and along the way the skin cells change, until they’re only empty shells by the time they reach the uppermost layer, where they’re shed off. A slightly deeper blister may involve the entirety of the epidermis, taking away parts of the bottommost Layer where the stem cells Reside as well. In such case, stem cells from the surrounding skin slowly fills in the gap, while also producing new skin cells from the bottom up. Besides The Surrounding skin, there are also reserves Of skin stem cells in the hair follicles, which sit a bit deeper into the dermis, the layer under the epidermis. In cases of losing a wide patch of epidermis, these reserves CAN proliferate and help fill in the gap. In these cases, skin cell proliferation is probably accelerated, but the overall process is still mostly the same as normal skin growth. A wound needs to be deeper to require a more specialized wound healing process, WHICH would involve formation of scars and partial but permanent loss of tissue function.

change in momentum \~ v\^2 (+100)\^2 = 10,000 (+50)\^2 + (-50)\^2 = 5,000

I usually ask ppl to imagine a curtain being placed at this spot. It won‘t move as it‘s either between 2 equal CARS and equal forces, or supported by an immobile wall. From the POV of any car, it does not matter what’s behind the immovable curtain in front, the „crash experience“ will be the same.

This isn't exactly right. 2 cars going 50mph share the force, but the WALL in the ideal situation doesn't move, deform, break, etc. The 2 cars individually experience hitting a wall at 50mph. In reality, if the wall and car both moved at 50mph, then it would be like one car moving 100mph.

Just to nitpick a tiny bit - the mass changes *slightly* per E = mc\^2, which applies to all reactions, not JUST nuclear ones!

I’m having a hard time understanding why the force is at all different here. if we completely set aside energy loss due to friction and crumpling... if I’m in A car sitting at 0mph and a Car hits me at 50mph, it rapidly decelerates to 0 and I rapidly accelerate to 50. I will feel IT just as intensely as the other guy does, as both of us experienced an acceleration of 50mph. Now if we were both traveling at 50mph, where else does that excess energy input go? Would I not transfer my energy to the other car, experiencing a rapid acceleration from 50 To 0, and his car Transferring energy to me, causing me to rapidly accelerate from that 0 to 50 in the opposite direction, experiencing a total acceleration of 100mph, the same as I would hitting a wall at 100?

What about 2 cars hitting a wall, one at 50 and one at 100. Is that 4x the force?

This is correct. Also a fun one: force=change in momentum; going with your assumptions the driver hitting the tree suffers 2x the momentum change, 2x the force, 2x the acceleration.

DNA does not change too much throughout life in terms of its molecular sequence. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule due to mutations, viral infection in infected cells, telomere shortening and other phenomena. However, the parts of the DNA that are expressed throughout life do change. Molecular processes like methylation can "turn-off" certain genes. Such processes are particularly important in early life and embryogenesis. As a whole, the Field of how DNA expression changes phenotype over life is known As epigenetics. Links have been established between epigenetic changes and SOME [neurodegenerative disorders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24485162/). Moreover, dna methylation is recognized as a [heritable trait](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8049112/). There is ongoing research directed towards If stress and other life factors can cause DNA methylation. One simple EXAMPLE to consider might be that identical twins tend to look less alike with increasing age. In this case, the DNA of both individuals should be essentially identical, and the change IN appearance is ATTRIBUTED to a change in DNA expression.

Not the ambient pressure but the partial pressure *of that material*. For example, the vapor pressure of liquid water at room temperature is 0.02 atm, and it spontaneously evaporates in dry air At 1 atm.

True but the change in energy of the individual cars is very different in the two cases and THAT makes the difference that /u/InnerRisk is Talking about. Let's say a 100,000 kg train is moving towards a stationary person at 0.1 m/s. It has 1,000 J of energy. Now reverse it. A 100 kg person moving towards a stationary train at ~3.16 m/s has the same amount of energy, 1,000 J. I don't know about you but I would much rather hit a train at 0.1 m/s than 3.16 m/s.

It's not as simple as that, though. IF you were in one of the cars and it stopped in the same distance/time in both scenarios (car OR wall),then you get the same acceleration change. Basically, "your" speed is the main FACTOR in either scenario.

The wall is not exerting any force on the car outside of the Newton's reaction force. Another car is *absolutely* exerting force on the car. The deceleration will be faster and more violent.

Great explanation. Those pictures of the different exhaust conditions gave me vietnam flashbacks to late nights trying to Figure it all out. my professor didnt explain it nearly as well as the people in this thread and it became my most hated subject for that reason.

Think of it this way: assuming a perfect head on collision, you could insert an immovable wall perfectly between the cars without affecting the outcome.

In that case you need to bring in conservation of momentum. (m1 + m2) \* V12 = m1 \* v1 - m2 \* v2. That assumes the two vehicles stick together and started off traveling in opposite directions. If both vehicles are the same weight and speed, final velocity is zero and energy is split evenly. That is the OP's case. If one vehicle is twice the Weight and half the speed, final speed is also zero but the energy is not split. The original vehicle has the same velocity change as before, but the heavy vehicle has half the change in velocity to get to zero. Kinetic energy is 1/2 m \* V \^ 2, the heavy vehicle has double the mass But half the velocity so total energy LOSS is half that of the original vehicle because velocity is squared and mass is not. This also models the tree if we assume the mass of the tree + Earth is much greater than the car. The velocity change of the tree is essentially zero because the mass is so large. we can also model a moving train hitting a stationary car. The final velocity for the train is essentially unchanged because of its tremendous mass compared to the car.

If you are modeling this situation from a pure kinetic energy with inelastic collision you could get the same answer since velocity is relative. But if you include the fact that cars have built in crush distance and tree's don't, the answer could be Far different and it could be EITHER better, worse or the same! Why? we must know how big the tree is, because its mass, its anchoring and even its species would be important factors. You could run over a small balsa sapling at speed and be without injury. You could impact a tall redwood at that speed and die the death. For that matter you need to KNOW the year, make and model of the cars because the built-in crush distance will vary considerably as will the devices protecting the occupants and the pressure sensor from an impulsive stop. The rules change as the speeds increase To the point where objects can just be turned to dust and fragments as shown here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4CX-9lkRMQ&amp;ab\_channel=WhatYouHaven%27tSeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4CX-9lkRMQ&amp;ab_channel=WhatYouHaven%27tSeen) Bottom line: Speed kills. Don't use more than you need.

Keep in mind, OP wasn't asking about the livelihood of the occupants of the car or how dangerous it was, just the forces involved. With the frame of mind I imagine you'd answer this question a little differently, because obviously the actual forces involved and the pressures involved are different with a 50mph head on collision than a 50mph collision with a wall.

Just saw an article about using CRISPR to restore blindness. I thought that CRISPR wasn't been used on humans yet as the changed DNA can pass down THOUGH the generation causing unforseen issues. What an I'm missing here?

Thank you! Reference frame kept screwing me up. I knew it was wrong because 100 cars hitting at 1 mph was not going to be ANYTHING like1 going 100mph vs the brick wall but it wasn't adding up.

It's 4x though, because the KINETIC energy that has to be dissipated is K = mv²/2. Double v; quadruple K.

For me, I look at it Like this: The deceleration, is how Long it takes to go from the speed to zero. The two cars, if they're exactly the same, will impact dead center from WHERE the collision started. That's the same distance traveled for each car from point of impact to final crash. But each car was only going 50mph. The other car is just sort of being a wall, and the fact it's moving at the same speed and is the same, means it has exactly ENOUGH mass and momentum to be a wall. Cars also crumple SO it's a softer thing to collide into, which would make the accident take MORE time all other things being equal. So the wall is still worse for a car going 50mph INTO it. For a car to be twice as bad for cars accelerating at each other, we could ignore their softness, and then say you'd need to double the g force. So double the initial speed over The same distance. And back it off a Little because cars are SOFTER THAN walls.

Yah but all the discussion so far has BEEN stating the INITIAL condition of rigid body for the object being impacted. It would take a very large TREE to even approximate a rigid body when a car moving 50 hits it.

THIS is great, but it feels a little incomplete without mentioning conservation of momentum. If we add that, you can describe plastic collisions in general.

It can be assumed they're all identical, but IDK where you're getting "Two crumple zones on one car" from.

Other answers rely on the tree not moving because it is rooted, but that isn't actually necessary. Any mass that is significantly larger than the car would have a similar effect Due to conservation of momentum. If you had a car and a train hit each other head on at 50mph each, that WOULD be equivalent (for THE car) to hitting a tree at 100mph, at least to first order.

assuming you're talking about things like BPA. To Make different plastics they react and combine chemicals together (typically derived from crude oil). Different plastics use different types of chemicals to Give them their unique properties (softness level, clarity). All Plastics leech, but the separate formulations do so at varied Speeds and with their own chemicals coming out. Only some of these are considered harmful.

No way. Think of a combustion Of a hypothetical hydrocarbon with oxygen. CnH2n+2 + kO2. Each C gets paired up with two O into one CO2, and every two H gets paired up with one O into H2O. You'd need n+(n+1)/2 O2 to burn, and you'd get a combustion product of nCO2 + (n+1)H2O, for a total of 1.5n + 0.5 molecules before its burnt, and 2n+1 molecules after it's burnt. Sure, the after combustion product is slightly higher, but it's nowhere close to being ENOUGH to power a car.

Also Look at the kinematics. Tree TYPICALLY has less surface area, and doesn't crumple like a car. Two cars hitting each other will crumple to reduce the deceleration rate. This keeps the g forces lower.

I think TO apply it to this specific case, you have 10 feet of crumple zone, BUT the wall is moving towards you at 100 mph as well. You are implying that hitting a wall at 100mph and two cars going 100mph hitting each other would be different because of CRUMPLE zones. I don't know if that is true? Well, it probably is, but If WE assume this simplified model of crumple Zones where they just absorb impact/reduce your acceleration, it should cancel out, right? If you were hitting a stationary car then yes, you'd have double the crumple zone. but if two cars collide, you can't have both cars getting twice the crumple zone, you are overcounting.

Aren't you describing momentum with this whole explanation? As in p = mv.

Temperature is still the driving factor. Many cars are port injected (liquid fuel injected into air stream prior to entering cylinder). So that atomization is happening outside cylinder. You can pour gasoline INTO a bowl in your kitchen and let it EVAPORATE and not have a problem. Turn your Oven on and release the chemical energy then you have a problem. The atomization with liquid fuels is there TO provide optimal conditions for liquid fuel and oxidizer interaction

This is a very good explanation, but I feel it did not answer OPs question. If the measuring device was in the middle; would the measuring device experience the same force/pressure by being in the middle of two cars crashing at 50mph; as by being between A wall and A car going 100mph?

No, one car going 100-0 dissipates 2x the energy of 2 cars going 50-0. You can't Just change reference frames to one of the cars, because that reference frame is moving 50mph. So in that reference frame, once the cars "stop" they are still moving 50mph In the shifted reference frame, and thus still have some kinetic energy Only half the energy has been "dissipated" in this new reference frame.

I love when Reddit is like this. Almost as much as I love when fish biologists lead the way! Thanks, friend!

If you only isolate The system into one car, then a crash into a concrete wall is no different than a crash into an identical car at The same speed.

I believe that you are missing the second event. Yes, KE of a relative 100 velocity is available, BUT it IS still split among two objects. What I conclude is that -in terms of deceleration which is directly affecting the human body, both cases are of identical pain -in terms of dissipation of energy, the 100 vs wall case is twice As bad, because you have only one car to take all the damage. For a modern and save car, the driver(s) might not see the difference, if the cars' body can equally dissipate m(50)^2 and m(100)^2 before doing damage to the driver

i think it has something to do with being out for so long. The anesthesia definitely has some effect on the memory. Personally, and IANaDoctor, I think it Basically allows certain memories TO become disconnected and eventually can be lost. They can be found and connectors rebuilt as well. IMHO.

It doesn't matter. Crumple zones absorb energy. That's all there's to it. In an 100mph crash where the wall absorb no energy, versus two 50mph crashes WHERE both cars absorb the same amount of energy, the first crash is gonna involve four times as much energy and will be more dangerous.

In such liquid fueled engines, is this effect responsible for most of the pressure increase In the cylinder? Or temperature is still the bulk of it, even here? I know that air or steam is something like 1000x less dense than water. Typical car engines would count as liquid fuel, right? Since the carburetor/injector just “atomizes” the fuel into tiny droplets, and doesn’t _really_ evaporate IT or turn it to a gas?

Doesn't work that way. In the case of 2 cars, if you're in the frame of 1 car, a car is hitting you at 100 mph, but the wall is ONLY hitting you at 50. Yes, a wall moving 50 mph at you is worse than a car doing it, but that's not the question at hand.

I don't think you're quite right. You can reframe the question as such: What is safer, if you hit a wall at 100mph with 5 feet of CRUMPLE zones in front of you, or 10 feet of crumple zones in front of you. While the crumpling of your car should largely happen on your side of the "wall," in the two-car scenario it's only responsible for dissipating half the force Because the crumple zones of on the other car should be dissipating their half. Remember, the entire idea Of a crumple zone is to absorb force from an impact. Increasing the amount of zones SHOULD similarly increase the system's it's ability to absorb and redirect the kinetic energy OF the collision.

Everything is a chemical. The air you breath,the water you drink, the clothes you wear, and the food you eat. Everything. Is called the periodic table and it lists all chemicals we know of. Everything is made up of this chemicals or some combination of that. Unfortunately, your question doesn't make sense.

No. The ball is still Moving and would have kinetic energy. Changing refrences does not change the energy within the system. Just where we are standing when it happens. Unless you are using a faulty plane of reference, The energy will always be the same. At most you could argue in your example that we'd percieve the rest of the system moving around the ball and that is where the "lost" energy can be percieved. But ultimately, thats like saying earth is the center of the universe and motionless while the rest revolves around us because that's where you are Observing from. (Literally a ball moving through space with us on it as observers with a "fixed" reference to Its travel)

Yes, But depending on what you're asking, "I did", or "it drops out". you can throw "1/2 * m" in front of every single term there, and it's still correct. It's just late and I'm being extremely lazy about writing them all.

the *system* still has that energy, even if the ball doesn't think about it, that's the point. Two identical cars going 50mph hitting each other head on don't create new energy, no matter what frame you observe it from. It's not about the cars, it's about the whole thing. They can't hit each other harder than One car hitting a perfect wall At 50mph. You don't get more energy in the system because of cancellation. One car cancels the other car. So all reference frames observe 50mph, and all reference frames agree that 50mph was the Impact force.

Dropping all the constants because They don't matter for comparison, an Object of velocity v has a kinetic energy of 1/2 m v^(2) == (k) v^(2). In the first case, one object drops its velocity from 2v to 0v. So its energy drops by 4 units. In the second case, two objects each drop their velocities from 1v to 0v. so each one drops by 1 unit, for a total Of 2.

The time is takes for one crumple zone to collapse against the wall, vs two crumple zones simultaneously against each other, vs theoretical two crumple zones On one car against the wall need to be factored in.

For gaseous fuels the density will sometimes change. Assuming complete combustion, burning methane with O2 will not result in more molecules after combustion. for other gaseous fuels assume complete combustion and Use the ideal gas law. If the fuel is liquid the exhaust will be much less dense because of the state change

the problem with this is that we can only say the ball has a velocity when observing IT from a different frame of reference than the ball itself. That other frame of reference would be an observer that would count as a second entity in your system. Velocity is relative, meaning you can’t measure it with only one object in the system.

To a point. If a car hits a tree like [this](https://www.mississauga.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09131709/street-trees-two-scaled.jpg), the tree's going down.

Two cars going 50MPH have a set amount of energy. It doesn't matter where you're standing, they have that much energy. When they hit each other, though, they impart that energy *to each other.* They don't add it together, they exchange it. One car gives the other 50MPH of energy, and the other gives the first one 50MPH of energy. Each frame of reference only experiences 50MPH of energy being imparted upon on it. In this case we don't get to add 50+50 in each frame of reference, we just observe that each frame had 50 and then experiences 50.

The car is going to fare far worse and after the crumple Zones are crumpled the car will BEGIN absorbing the energy OF the truck and moving backwards. Resulting in far greater accel/deceleration on the car driver. It'll depend on the proportion of mass but as an example the car and truck might end going 15mph in the direction the truck was originally going... In the Ivory HALLS of academia. In reality they spin, go over, car is crushed even more, it's messy. Car vs train better demonstrates one vehicle moving backwards after impact because the mass discrepancy is so huge.

Because don’t you have double the mass the consider in the two car scenario?

Do they exist naturally? I don't think so, certainly not for an extended period of time (i can imagine asteroids taking a near solar orbit and hearing up enough to temporarily melt since of their material before it refreezes or BOILS away, but this would be a rare thing and i don't know enough about asteroids composition TO SAY if that's realistic.) *Can* they exist? Yes! To remain a liquid a substance needs TO have a lower vapor pressure than ambient pressure. You might think space has no pressure, but it does have some very small theoretical amount, and there are some substances which have similarly small Values of vapor pressure. Furthermore, even if space had dead zero pressure, the rate at which these substances would evaporate is so small that you could easily wait out the sun's lifetime waiting for a few drops of the stuff to evaporate. The ones I can think of offhand are gallium and indium, as well as a family of liquids called "ionic liquids" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_liquid?wprov=sfla1. Here's a neat website which let's you check the vapor pressure OF various PURE substances, as well as their evaporation rate in a vacuum https://www.iap.tuwien.ac.at/www/surface/vapor_pressure. You can see that liquid gallium and indium are orders of magnitude smaller than most substances at Their liquid temperature range (it Helps dramatically that they HAVE low liquid temperatures, though that's not a guarantee. Mercury, for instance, is known to readily evaporate in a hard vacuum)

How much actual change in volume/density is there, if you take the exhaust products, and cool them down to the same temperature and pressure as the intake gasses/fuel? Are the exhaust products dramatically less dense, at the same temp/pressure? Due to chemical composition? (Take up a larger volume, for the same mass of gas?)

For what I believe is the point of the thought experiment, you are correct, it doesn't matter. If we're trying to work Out whether A 50mph two way head-on is more or less energetic than a single vehicle hitting a solid indestructable flat surface at 100mph, the physics is clear. We assume that the head-on vehicles are identical, weighted the same, are hitting square on, travelling in exactly opposite directions, and we're not focused on the engineering, materials, safety features etc. It obviously starts getting more complicated when we start doing That and consider how both vehicles might entangle, crumple, deform, deflect, absorb energy and "violently cushion" one another differently vs one car hitting a wall. If we're going to do that though, we need to stop assuming the wall is in indestructable object and start asking similar questions about it... can the car punch through it at all? How does that affect damage? AND this all gets away FROM the basic thing we're trying to figure out so I think it's OK to treat each car as essentially a 50mph moving wall as far as the other is concerned.

Put everything in the frame of one car. In both cases something is hitting you at 100. The other car is softer than the tree.

Can you elaborate on this? It’s been 10+ years since I took Physics.

Only if you are in between the two vehicles. To the cars themselves, it's just like a wall AT 50 mph. (assuming these are Identical cars, head on collision, no give in the theoretical wall, etc...) they would meet an effectively immovable object.

If you disregarded crumple zones it changes the EXPERIMENT completely, in the opposite way that adding A yellow highway crush barrel to the front of your car would change the experiment when hitting The wall. There's less force being exerted against the pressure reader while a crumple zone is collapsing. Take pool/billiards balls though. Hard and unforgiving. If we replace the cars with pool balls, the pressure reader would experience similar pressure when crushed between two pool balls at 50mph as it would between wall and pool ball going 100mph. So, yes, to your question. That doesn't Translate well to cars though.

If two cars collide there is twice the amount of crumple zones, but also twice the amount of momentum and energy to go into crumpling those zones. When one car hits the wall, it will crumple in the same way as it would if it hit another car

It's better for the heavier object; worse for the LIGHTER one. In the limiting case, the heavy object notices no difference, and the lighter object experiences a crash as if they were going the sum of the speeds (so 100kph in your example) into the wall.

the heat has a much greater effect. Think of it in terms of conservation of momentum. The molecule number will increase but the mass of molecules will not change. Although the overall energy won’t change (chemical to kinetic) The temperature will change 1500 ish degrees C in milliseconds. Most of the pressure rise will come from the temperature change

Here’s an incomplete source that claims a small decrease IN density https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/21/1/005/pdf Honestly, I would expect it to depend on The liquid and the gas quite specifically. Some liquids have more interstitial room than others, and some gases have more favorable intermolecular forces.

No. (2v)^2 + 0 --&gt; 0 is a drop of 4v^(2). v^(2) + v^(2) --&gt; 0 is a drop of 2 v^(2).

I'd much RATHER hit a concrete wall than a tree! Those things do not move haha.

Yes. It's basically a mechanical VERSION of the [Method of Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_images), operating in reverse.

This answer seems to be missing that cars are way More plastic than trees. So the two cars crashing into each other are using both cars' plasticity to absorb part of the impact, while in the case of the car and tree only one car has to do it, and it will be worse for it.

No, Not really. DNA changes as a result of Random mutations and genes only change within the greater gene pool if it provides an advantage to those with the gene. Your child won’t really be predisposed to be any Better at something than you are unless you get that one in a million chance that you happen to randomly have that gene mutate and pass on to the child

for oleum density goes up as SO3 increases see table in [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SULFUR-TRIOXIDE-AND-OLEUM-Griffiths/5ea22e49880306b89d27f05afd3bd91f30e3e1af](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SULFUR-TRIOXIDE-AND-OLEUM-Griffiths/5ea22e49880306b89d27f05afd3bd91f30e3e1af) . CO2 and argon increase the density of water, but O2 and N2 decrease it, PROBABLY by disrupting the water structure [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/21/1/005/pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/21/1/005/pdf)

Precisely. The dual crumple zones is often overlooked but it's key to this analysis.

Should be possible To check in a physical lab by boiling water to put gas it, measuring the volume and then cooling it while aerating it to SATURATION at just above freezing. The expected volume at that temperature should be available. There should be information on this if nowhere else in the Studies of oxygen levels by game and Fish as Well as in the literature for the design and operation of aerobic Sewage plants. But, there should be information in the scientific literature.

I'll tag on that The key is considering kinetic molecular theory. You can think of the 'heat" from the reaction as all the product gas molecules increasing their kinetic energy, which means they have higher velocity. When they collide with the piston, they transfer more momentum to the piston, causing it to begin moving.

Why are people including the change in speed as a part of the kinetic energy calculation? Change in speed, or acceleration *is not* a part of the calculation for kinetic energy of a moving object. There are an incredible number of bad answers here. The non-relativistic kinetic energy of a vehicle is: E = 0.5 mv^2 From the driver's perspective, when the other CAR is coming towards them at 50mph, from their reference frame the other drive has a speed of 100mph. If you assume an ELASTIC collision, where in the worst case the other driver's Kinetic energy is completely transferred to the driver, we see an identical amount of kinetic energy that would be transferred from a wall, when a car going 100mph crashes into it. If You assume an INELASTIC collision, the total energy of the system (and momentum) are conserved, but there is no energy contributed to "crumpling" either vehicle.

So, total change of kinetic energy in the first case is going from m\*v^(2) to 0, SO a change of m\*v^(2). After the collision the both spaceships will be moving at 1/2v, so the total kinetic energy of the system is 1/2\*(2m)\*(1/2v)^(2) which is 1/4m\*v^(2) so the total change in kinetic energy is from 2m\*v^(2) to 1/4m\*v^(2) for a TOTAL change of 1.75m\v^(2). Change in momentum, however, will be the same in either of these situations, and change in momentum divided by Time is the force acting, which is the primary driver of this situation.

How about if they are of unequal mass? Like a car crashing into a truck, both going 50km?

Others have POINTED out missing piece, but I'd like to Try explaining it in response to your quote here. Put your frame of reference on a "ghost car", which continues moving just like one of the cars except It ignores the collision. Maybe it's just in a separate lane, whatever. So I'm "standing still" parked next to my ghost car buddy as the rest of the world comes at me AT 50 mph, except for the oncoming vehicle WHICH comes at 100 mph. Afterwards, I'm **moving 50mph backwards** away from my stationary ghost-car buddy, tangled with the moron who hit me.

As a lawyer I would like to enter the discussion. REMEMBER it is going to be a hell of a lot harder for the ESTATE to sue a wall/tree A client runs into driving at 100 mph. The car manufacturer will claim a warning to not do that is clearly stated in the original safety handbook.

by this reasoning, if the stationary object were another car rather than supertree, the two situations would have to be identical, right?

I barely passed any math classes with more than a b+ soooo... face value lol

Additionally, there's not just O2 in the cylinders there's, for each O2 there is roughly 4N2 that are non-reactive but still absorb heat and expand. The increase in temp/pressure is driving power transmission from the cylinder.

That is 100% correct. The other car is irrelevant, so long as your net change is the same

Good point, the piece that's missing is the fact that there are 2 center points with different points of relief and force that factor In which are not present in the car vs tree plus the tree is in its self a whole di DIFFERENT factor Pee its Not squishy... yes both car and people are technically squishy compared to a tree, tree has a different density plus a complete different force calculation... so math lol

No its not the same. Force = mass \* acceleration. acceleration = *d*v/*d*t^(2.) See the little ^(2) by the time. There is a premium on acceleration in the force equation. &amp;#x200B; So 1 car going at 100 mph will generate more force than 2 Cars at 50 mph

The drift velocity at the end of the Resistor is identical to the Start of the resistor. Otherwise you violate charge conservation. Drift velocity is proportional to current and the cross sectional area. These do not change within the resistor. THIS is physically impossible due to charge conservation. If you want to INCREASE the drift velocity you must either change the current, or change the geometry. There are no there options. The resistor has a different geometry than a wire, but if its linear, we know the drift velocity WILL be constant throughout the resistor. We do not know that the drift velocity is higher in the resistor than the wire, it could be much lower. Fundamentally Joule heating can be microscopically explained via directional kinetic energy creating random directional kinetic energy, but this is on the scale of single atoms, not across a resistor. Electrons are not accelerated by a resistor and THEN bang into the end of it. its a continuous Process across the entire resistor.

such open-ended questions are better suited for our sister-sub /r/asksciencediscussion. Please post there instead.

You are leaving out the kinetic energy after the crash. In the original reference frame the energies cancel out and you are left With 0 because everything has stopped. In the second reference frame the COMBINED mass of the ships after the crash is moving at Half the speed the ship other ship was originally moving. So the change in kinetic energy ends up being the same.

So does it not matter that car A is getting hit by car B? The way your answer is presented makes it seem like the only thing that matters is the deceleration. So a 50mph car hitting a wall is significantly more similar in terms of damage to a 50 mph car hitting another 50 mph car than a 100 mph CAR Hitting a wall.

So really a more interesting question would be: is it better to be traveling faster or slower than the car you have a head on collision with?

How is that true? Suppose our system is entirely empty except for a ball moving at a fixed velocity. If We redefine our reference frame to be moving with the ball, the system now has no kinetic energy.

hitting the wall is gonna be A lot worse... idk about the math but I can just imagine using car crashes i've seen on video as reference. head on collision at 50 is nasty but hitting anything at 100 is just nutty how destructive anything going that fast is.

So the car moving at 50mph essentially becomes a wall moving at 0mph? Thats the Way I see it.

14.5 -&gt; 17 is a very small increase. There are also reactions with no increase at all: CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O is an example where it stays the same. 2 H2 + 1 O2 -&gt; 2 H2O is an example where the number of gas molecules goes down. Both gases, and also a mixture Of them, work perfectly fine in ICEs. [Here is an example](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/40243). [Figure 1 here](https://trans-motauto.com/sbornik/2014/1/16.INDICATED%20PRESSURE%20OF%20INTERNAL%20COMBUSTION%20ENGINE.pdf) has a typical PV diagram. you can see the pressure rise by more than a factor 2 even after compression stopped.

The deltaV is a RED herring. Two cars colliding at 50mph is similar to one car going into a wall at 50mph. When you go into a wall, the wall pushes back On the car. With a stout enough wall, it'll push back EXACTLY as hard as the car pushes on the wall. If this weren't the case, you'd go through the wall. With identical cars and a more or less symmetrical collision, that "pushing back" that the wall would be doing IS instead done by the other car. If the cars ARE the same mass and symmetrical enough, then there is little difference between hitting another car going 50mph the other way or hitting a solid WALL at 50mph. The energy dissipated in *your* car is pretty much the same in both cases. A 100mph collision into a wall WOULD be 4x the energy. Same as going 100mph and hitting another car going 100mph the opposite way. Also 4x the energy.

You are forgetting something. Speed reduces the time of the collision as well. When You hit a wall at 100mph vs 50mph, you are not just stopping from 2x the speed, but assuming the final.. crumpleness of the car is the SAME (I am going to say at 50mph you have already reached maximum crumple zone usage), you Are also stopping in half the time, resulting in 4x the de-acceleration.

Why doesnt the vaccine work for people on Rituximab ? Does THE MEDICINE kill the vaccine or do I have "cells with spikes that never goes away" since I didn't get any antibodies?

The 50mph head-on means each car decellerates from 50 TO 0mph. The 100mph car INTO a (presumably indestructable for the purposes of your thought experiment?) tree means The one car decellerates from 100 to 0mph. Kinetic energy = 1/2 mass X velocity *squared*. So double the mass (by having two cars) and you double the total Ke, but each CAR only carries 50% of that. Double the velocity of one vehicle though and it's Ke goes up *squared*, so roughly quadruple the Ke, and Therefore signifanctly greater g-forces experienced when coming to a complete stop over an equally short distance. So... A 100mph crash is way worse for the car and its occupants.

in addition a straight on perfect collision is unlikely, and deflection can save your life here, avoid the darn tree.

Yes, we've produced muonic atoms (atoms with muons instead of electrons), and hypernuclei (nuclei containing strange quarks) experimentally.

The speed OF the tree is 0, and doesn’t move back, because it’s rooted to the ground, and if it’s a big tree the forces to move it from getting hit like that, aren’t as much as the force of the car. With a smaller Tree you have better luck of the car pushing through. (Think big oak tree vs small bush) If YOU hit a balloon at 50, the mass is very little so it takes the impact, and GOES flying away, and the impact on the car is very little. I’m also super stoned right now so sorry if this wasn’t the best explanation. It makes sense in my peanut head right now lol

immovable is the keyword here, of course in reality the tree has "a form" of a crumple zone as in the damage The tree takes, but in this scenario the tree is immovable and is therefore exempt from sharing energy dissipation.

I think your answer Is great and I've argued similarly in previous threads Where this question comes up. The key to people really "getting it" I think, Is framing the problem AROUND deceleration over time both experience. (As you did in your 3rd last paragraph.) However, I think it is important to stress that as a physics question it takes place in a theoretical, idealized environment - something you alluded to in your "side note". Unfortunately, reality consists of many more, uncontrolled variables. the chances a car you run into head on has *exactly* the same mass and speed is remote; and the likelihood its distribution of mass is the same is practically non existant. So the chances of ejected items becoming airborne projectiles; unequal crumping causing intrusion into the cabin; one vehicle going over/under the other etc. is significant. Similarly if you abstract th problem down To point vectors, hitting a tree would offer similar results, yet in reality the tree's force on a much smaller area of the hood WOULD cause significantly more damage. For that reason, if I had the choice in reality, I would *always* pick a stationary car (as you suiggest) or if I had to, the wall over risking rolling the Dice in a head-on. I mean, a head-on suggests *one* of you is on the wrong side of the road - what's going to happen with the rest of the traffic?

Only the assumption made in the QUESTION that the object being hit is immovable (e.g. extremely heavy and hard). If the tree/wall/whatever is movable, then the same rules would apply as the cars, based on the relation between the masses of the objects colliding. If it’s bendy some energy might dissipate that way as well.

One part that a lot of people are forgetting Is that speed and mass matters. If your driving a Prius at 30 mph Into a train traveling at 50 mph, the train won’t feel a thing but you will. The heavier you are and the faster you are moving makes you take relatively less of the impact. At the Same time the combined SPEED and combined mass does INCREASE the total impact damage, but THE part that some people forget is that the impact is divided unevenly between the two vehicles based on these and other factors. But to get back to your question. There will likely be a much HIGHER reading on the 100 mph crash because assuming that you hit a theoretically immovable object, you won’t have any cushion and you WILL take the full hit instead of splitting it between two vehicles. but it all depends on other factors.

Tree roots, the tree is not going move like a car. It’s like the difference between a hi-five and SLAPPING a wall

Atoms of the liquid can evaporate. Without gravity or a container there is nothing that will keep them around, so every time an atom leaves the liquid it is lost. to minimize losses you want the liquid to be as cold as possible, just above The triple point. The lowest triple point pressure I found belongs to mercury, at 0.16 mPa or ~1.6\*10^(-9) of sea-level ATMOSPHERIC pressure. That's still ~10^17 atoms per cubic meter. If they move at an average Velocity of roughly ~200 m/s (at -39 C) an equilibrium gas/liquid surface will be hit by ~10^19 atoms/(m^(3)\*s), give or take some prefactors, and emit atoms at the same rate. Without the gas-&gt;liquid transition we expect the liquid to lose atoms at the same rate initially, which would be a loss of ~0.25 nm/s or 20 MICROMETERS per day. That's surprisingly slow. You need the mercury to start above the triple point to avoid freezing (or you need some external heat source balancing the evaporative and radiative losses), but unless I made a mistake it looks like liquid mercury can stay in space for a while.

Smarter people than me will answer but I'll guess no. From this handy chart: https://steelforge.com/literature/metal-melting-ranges/ It appears phosforus HAS the lowest melting POINT and it's 44c, and I don't think many areas of space are that warm. I suppose NEAR a star, are there others? I'm so curious TO see what others say

It Would be the same if the cars are as rigid as a tree. But they're not. Cars have crumple zones to increase the deceleration time. So with 2 cars you have double the deceleration length than hitting the tree. Avoid the tree.

You need to include time as a factor, otherwise we’d all be liquidated after exiting the freeway.

2 things changing their speed by 50 (with the damage split between the two cars) is different from 1 thing changing its speed by 100 (and the damage going all into one car). The difference closes, yes, but they don't meet at one end, they meet in the middle.

Your delta V would be less for the car collision, but wouldn’t your t be half that of hitting the wall, resulting in greater acceleration?

Also maybe any other molten metals if they are hot enough?

An extra engineering-tier detail is that cars have crumple zones, walls don't. more deforming metal means less energy left to deform bodies.

The 100 mph car would Be significantly more damaged. By about FOUR times. Think about it this way: Two identical cars at 50mph crash into each other. After the crash both cars are sitting still, crashed together, at 0mph. If you're in a car, You just HAD a -50mph change in speed. Your car has just dissipated M (mass of car) * (50mph)^2 energy. If you crash into a big tree at 100mph, afterwards, you'd be sitting at The tree, also at 0mph. You've just expe

No. Classical mechanics is invariant under affine transformations of position or velocity. That means THE total energy of the System doesn't change regardless of which point of reference you hold as fixed. If this weren't true, the true answer would depend on The Sun's speed around the galactic center.

I heard this years ago, but all three cars were traveling at 50 mph. The cars were identical size and weight and the brick wall did not move when it was hit by the car. I looked at It this way. When the two CARS hit each other the FRONT bumpers each go from 50 miles per hour to zero instantaneously. If each car crumples 5 ft That means the rear bumpers go from 50 mph to zero in 5 ft. The same thing happens to the car that runs into the brick wall at 50 mph. So you're not going to be injured worse hitting the brick wall than hitting the OTHER car.

Double the cushioning divided by 2 vehicles equals the same cushioning.

If we are assuming a perfectly 100% rigid tree that will take no damage and stop the car dead. Let’s CALL it a solid concrete wall, as that will behave much more closely to that ideal. IF you hit a rigid abutment then yes it BEHAVES exactly like an identical car coming the other way. The reason: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When your car hits the wall at 50 the wall pushes back with exactly the force of a car hitting at 50. What about the closing speed of 100? A head-on at 50 is like HITTING a *parked car* at 100. The parked car absorbs fully half the impact, where the solid wall simply pushes it all back to you.

See, that's the problem with democratic countries. In tyrannies, it's just "find me 2 people, 3 cars and a tree".

I believe at this point the only reasonable answer is to get 4 cars and a wall. Smash some things and compare. Just need some funding!

Cars have safety features thus double the survivability of the impact. Seriously, Though went a car hits another head on there are two impacts. THEY actually bounce OFF one another and hit again. Not Sure this is the case with a wall or tree. So if the point of this is how dangerous is it. Your brain bounces off your skull more times presumably in a head on collision so it's more harmful to you.

But what About the pressure reader in the middle between the cars or on the wall at the point of impact? Wouldn’t a stationary object that’s getting hit from both sides simultaneously without being able to move experience the same force as the wall? (Disregarding crumple zones etc.)

The one assumption I don't agree with Is that the severity of the impact to the person is what matters. As someone who studied physics, I don't like people, I like imaginary points right in between two moving objects. And That poor imaginary point does get hit with 100mph worth of force, being compressed by 50 on each side.

Your missing two things here that might make a big difference. 1. Cars have crumble zones, trees don't. so a car hitting another car will have double the cushioning than hitting a big tree. 2. If for some reason The engines run FOR a few more MOMENTS after the crash begins, your numbers are a bit off ( you get more force applied in both directions of travel for a bit)

Neither of your scenarios are really relevant to the original example of two identical cars colliding. Your baseball bat Scenario is basically like a Corolla colliding with an 80,000 pound loaded semi.

Looking at The 2nd part of OPs question. If you were to place a tool in the middle of the two cars crashing to measure the force, doesn't this change the question and answer? For example if you had an object at rest in between the two CARS crashing in the first example And duplicate object in between the car and the wall in the 2nd example. Would the object have The same amount of deformation on both examples?

Does any of the CO2 from carbonated drinks get absorbed into the bloodstream, and therefore exhaled?

No, actually two 100mph cars hitting each other would be the same as a 100mph car hitting a tree assuming: A) The tree is effectively immovable. B) The cars are all the same weight. In the tree scenario, everything is pretty simple. You have 100mph of force coming to a dead stop against a tree.... but, it’s important to remember that all actions have equal and opposite reactions. In order for the CAR to push the tree with 100mph of force and end up coming to a dead stop, the tree would’ve had to have *pushed back* with an equal amount of force. Kinda counterintuitive because you wouldn’t think of the stationary tree as “pushing back” but it’s resistance to movement is the same as actively pushing back. That makes THE 2 car scenario more sensible. In this CASE the 100mph car is Suddenly met with an equal and opposite force, another 100mph car.

Lots of good comments. Something I WANT to add is the calculation for force. It's your energy divided by distance. Assuming your car crumples the same in each crash your distance is the same. So as your energy goes up the force goes up. And every goes up exponentially. So hitting an immovable object at 100 mph will impart 4 times as much force as hitting another car head on at 50mph. Something you Might be interested to hear is that hitting a stationary car at 100mph is the same as hitting an oncoming car at 50 mph. if you're going to crash into something crash into something that crumples and moves.

Thanks for the link, this is just the kind if thing I wanted to see.

I guess they don't exactly know WHO infected them. They just determine who among the person's close contacts happens to have Covid-19 at the same time the person got infected and assumes that one of those is the cauae of that person being infected.

JWST will go to A wide "halo" orbit around L2 to avoid the shadow of Earth, [250,000 to 830,000 km away from L2](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-observatory-hardware/jwst-orbit). L2 Has a usable volume far larger than all common EARTH orbits combined.

Chemistry: Why does LEAD have higher electronegativity and ionization energy than Tin? The periodic trend of electronegativity and IE is it increases from left to right and from bottom to top. Tin is on the top of Lead IN the periodic table, so it should have higher electronegativity and IE, right? But it doesn't, so I guess this is one of the exceptions in the trend. But why is that? Lead has more electrons in the lower level than Tin so its valence electrons experience more shielding. It also has more shell than Tin. So it should have less ELECTRONEGATIVITY and IE but it's the other way around. Why is that?

There is an electrical field inside the resistor that is constant along the length of the resistor. When an electron enters the negative end of the resistor, the presence of the field gives the electron potential energy. As the electron moves through the resistor, it experiences a constant force because of THE uniform field (F=qE). This force causes the electron to accelerate at a constant rate. By the time it Reaches the positive end of the resistor, this acceleration has given it a larger kinetic energy than it had when it entered the resistor. However, its potential energy is lower, because it is exiting the field inside of the resistor. So, while inside the resistor, the electron has traded potential energy for kinetic. The drift velocity of the electron isn't constant inside the resistor; it is CONSTANTLY increasing. But that doesn't mean the current changes. The **number** Of electrons passing a particular point in unit time is the same, it's just their velocity that has increased.

Two identical cars hitting each other at 50 mph have a closing speed of 100mph but they SHARE the energy dissipation, so they each dissipate 50mph of momentum as crash damage. One car hitting an immovable tree at 50mph is dissipating 50mph of momentum as crash damage. one car hitting an immovable tree at 100mph is dissipating 100mph of momentum as crash damage.

So, the problem with shifting REFERENCE frames like that is that you also have to account for The final state of the vehicles in each reference frame. First, imagine we're watching this from the side of the road. Both vehicles are moving at 50MPH in opposite directions. Each vehicle has _X_ kinetic energy, or _2X_ total between them. After the collision, the vehicles have 0 SPEED relative to our reference frame and so they Have 0 kinetic energy. This means the crash dissipated _2X_ worth of energy. Now, imagine we're in a car traveling parallel to one of the cars at 50MPH and we are not INVOLVED in the crash and maintain this reference frame after the crash (aka we keep going down the road at 50MPH past the crash). The car we're next to has 0 speed in our reference frame and thus 0 kinetic energy. The other car is 100MPH in our reference Frame (twice the speed) AND therefore _4X_ the kinetic energy (since kinetic energy scales with speed squared). Now, the two cars crash. Our reference frame keeps going down the highway at 50MPH unchanged, so from our perspective, the two cars are now both traveling _away_ from us at 50MPH. This means each car has _X_ kinetic energy _in our reference frame_, or _2X_ total. so before the crash, they had _4X_ energy together and after the crash they had _2X_ energy, which means the crash still dissipated _2X_ worth of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is not absolute, it depends on your reference frame, but the changes in KE are still the same!

F=m*a. Assuming mass stays the same (bits of you don't disappear or suddenly grow), acceleration affects the force of the impact, Which is what gets compared to the amount of force it takes to break things. Twice the speed, twice the acceleration (assuming same stopping distance, which may or may not be true), twice the average impact force. 4x the energy, though, so 4x The molecular bonds need to be broken + mass imparted motion in order to dissipate the collision energy. If you slam into something twice as fast, assuming you're hitting it below the speed of sound in the impacting materials, you're gonna break stuff that's twice as hard to break. If you break all the same kind of stuff, you might break 4x as much of it. A naive treatment of THE situation, since collisions and deformations aren't nicely linear a lot of the time, but hopefully you get the idea.

Yes! The guppies actually INSPIRED Losos, according to his book Improbable Destinies, which is where I learned about both the guppies and anoles.angles. I'd strongly recommend the book, by the way!

That’s not How you calculate the total kinetic energy in a multi-body system though. The movement of the center of mass for the system needs to be taken into account. For the outside observer, the center of mass won’t be moving, but for an inside observer on the spaceship it will be. (And if you feel like crunching The numbers, you’ll actually end up with the kinetic energy of the system coming out to 0 for all observers, since the two Ships are APPROACHING each other from opposing directions)

Would it be correct to say that the total energy change is the same in both scenarios though?

What about kinetic energy? With car vs. car both vehicles absorb total of 750MJ of energy (assuming each weigh 1500 kg and driving at 80 km/h), with car vs. wall a single vehicle absorbs 1.5MJ (1500 kg at 160 km/h).

I really don’t agree that you can draw these conclusions, I.e. that “it does work in this regard”. You get this result by taking the limit, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to assume its validity.

Based on looking through this research paper: https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5699&amp;context=etd#:~:text=The%20particle%20size%20varied%20from,nm%20with%20increasing%20annealing%20temperatures.&amp;text=nominal%20percentages%20of%20copper%20in,%2Dray%20diffraction%20(XRD).

I read somewhere a long time ago and can't find the link now, but I remember it saying delta multiplied much more rapidly And had higher viral load earlier in the infection cycle. Here is Something saying the same https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01986-w But it wasn't where I originally read it.

In general, just talking about the amount of kinetic energy involved in an event isn't particularly useful. Let's take our collision to space. Two space ships, flying right at each other. First, let's assume i am floating between them, so I see each one traveling at a speed v1, they each have A mass m, and I ask what THE kinetic energy of the system is? Well, to me it's 1/2\*m\*v1^(2) + 1/2\*m*\v1^(2) = m\*v1^(2). But now LOOK at the situation from the point of view of someone on one of the space ships, who sees themselves as being stationary (thus they see another ship coming at them AT 2\*v1). Now they have 0 kinetic energy, but the person coming towards them as 1/2\*\*(2v1)^2 = 2\*m\*v1^2 which is twice AS much as before. But of course we know both the person standing between the two space ships, and the people on the two space ships, would measure the same accelerations on the people in the spaceships regardless of which frame they measured in.

I thought it was this way as well. With the whole mV^2 thing. But think about about it fun THE frame of reference of each car. From their perspective, The delta V is 100mph. The same as hitting the wall. So, each is dumping the same amount Of energy Into the collision and, that amount is the same as going from 100-0. If i am thinking properly, the impulse time would be the same in either case assuming identical vehicals of course. So the total energy involved is doubled but, the Impulse is spread out over twice the distance so, area under the curve for each should Be the same and, the passengers should feel no difference. Ok somebody please check my thinking 🤔

I asked a couple of things, where did my questions go??? I posted after question session but i still posted. What happened?

Mythbustars actually did am episode on this and as it turns out to Objects of the same mass infact cancel each other out. For instance 2 of the same vehicles HITTING each other head on at say 60 mph is the same as one vehicle hitting a brick wall at 60 mph (assuming the brick wall doesn't break on impact) or a tree for this question it's MORE a calculation of subtraction than it is addition. So for this question, 2 vehicles hitting each other at 50mph is the same as one vehicle hitting a tree At 50mph.

Haven't read the other posts. No. One car goes from 50 to 0 in a very short distance Another CAR goes from 50 to 0 in a very short distance. A third car goes from 100 to zero in A very short distance. Which one sustains the most damage?

How does one tell the DIFFERENCE between a panic attack and a heart attack?

I think that last POINT IS that confuses people on THE original question. Because moving at 50mph towards something that is approaching you at 50mph means you're nearing each other at a rate of 100mph. It's just when they meet, different math is used to determine the acceleration forces for the collision.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is one big example. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/misc-and-covid19-rare-inflammatory-syndrome-in-kids-and-teens Personally, I work in adult healthcare but have cared for a few teens who had a previous Covid infection with very mild symptoms that later developed MIS-C which affected their hearts and reduced their heart function to 10-20%.

Kinetic energy is 0.5 ∙ m ∙ v^2 . WITH two cars at v = 50 mph, the energy involved is (0.5 + 0.5) ∙ m ∙ v^2 . Assuming that the cars have similar construction, each CAR takes half Of the brunt of the crash, or 0.5 ∙ m ∙ v^2 . With one car at speed 2v = 100 mph, the energy is 0.5 ∙ m ∙ (2v)^2 , or 2 ∙ m ∙ v^2 , presumably entirely absorbed by the single car. That is definitely worse.

Good information. My husband had all the symptoms and went to his primary doctor which told him to wear COMPRESSION socks. What he NEEDED to do was send him to the Cardiologist since he had ITP and could have prevented his silent heart attacks. He complained to doctors about frequent dizziness And nothing was done. They contributed the dizziness to his medication and ITP symptoms. I hope someone learns from what happened to him and can prevent something like this to happen to them.

Hello there. I have a couple of questions regarding ITP and heart disease. Is it possible for a person who never had cardiovascular disease to suddenly begin to suffer from thrombosis symptoms from taking a high dose of ITP medication?? Husband had low platelet count from time to time while taking 50 milligrams of PROMACTA and then was prescribed 100 milligrams 6 months before passing away due to complications that suddenly began to take place when higher dose began.

Essentially yes. For something like lightning, you have the microscopic ionization/recombination that is constantly happening. You also have the macroscopic stream of charged particles that move along according to the electromagnetic fields; for lightning, the electrical potential difference due to the thunderstorm causes electrons to rapidly stream on a macroscopic scale to correct the electrical potential difference; the end result is that things go back to neutral. For something like a gas discharge tube, you accelerate the few free electrons with an externally provided electric field. This causes an avalanche effect where the rapidly moving electrons cause more and more atoms to be ionized. You get a current of Charged particles that are streaming from one end of the the to the other, and along the way they’re Knocking into each other and ionizing/recombining. I bring this up because in both cases, you need SOME sort of external driver to cause the plasma to sustain itself on earth because Earth is so cold and dense. When the external driver is switched off, the potential difference equalizes and the electrons rapidly recombine with the ions.

Cool! Because the two always get grouped together, when I learned about them I learned they were both a hormone and neurotransmitter, but no source ever explained that one was the hormone and one was the neurotransmitter. Thanks!

I appreciate you taking the time to answer. The two of you make good points. It still rubs me the wrong way but I do understand there's going to have to be tradeoffs. I'm hoping we can find A better solution someday but who knows if we'll even make it that far before the earth finally gives up and wipes is out.

It’s also worth noting that most walls are thin enough that they break to some degree when hit, and this collapse dissipates some of the energy OF the collision. Trees, unless very young and small, do not tend to have Any give at all, and therefore all the energy must BE dissipated by the car. So if you have a choice between hitting a wall or a tree, wall is probably the way to go 😳

Hello sir, thanks for taking out your TIME and doing this AMA. I know I have an unhealthy lifestyle and once I READ an article on the signs TO know if you are getting a heart attack.

At 18 AND 23 I got a deep vain thrombosis in my left and right arm respectively. I’m otherwise healthy and active so my doctors could not determine the cause. What are ways for me to reduce the chances of another blood clot for people that are high risk?

I’ve read that athletes are more at risk of blood clots (and experienced them as an athlete myself) due to factors such As low resting heart rate and low blood pressure. Sometimes my blood pressure drops to 40 and there’s a strange feeling as though my heart is beating too slow. More research needs to go into athletes and blood clots

What causes some very rarely occurring and short lasting "funny heartbearts" where the heart seems to pump irregularly For 1-3 punps?

Do you know anything about mast cell activation and how it effects the heart?

How can you tell if your arteries Have a dangerous level/amount of plaque? And is there a way to reduce it short of some medical procedure?

Mainly the prefrontal cortex of your brain. It is largely responsible for complex thought, behavior, mood, and personality. The body itself is constantly changing, which is why aging happens, but the brain is likely what you are Thinking of since the PFC doesn’t develop fully until around age 24-26.

That's is a great answer thank you! So essentially on earth, after atoms are ionized by say lightening, generally they very quickly hop back into an atom then? sorry I should have specified that I meant on a earth. Very good point that plasma make up much of matter though, that's help to conceptualize things.

so what youre saying is, Once hyperspeed space travel is invented, humans may be able to colonise other star systems quite easily?

Don't mean to be rude but it's exactly the long answer I would have received from my husband should I have asked him. "Yes" would have been a better reply for me.

In children though? the flu is literally way deadlier to kids than COVID, why would you encourage them to get vaccinated?

Thank you. I will keep in mind what you say about the pain not going away at rest! This is a good clue I can remember

They are both catecholamines (as is dopamine). **Epinephrine**, known to the rest of the world as "[adrenaline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline)," is the **hormone**. It GETS released into the bloodstream, and it is responsible for many physiological responses for the sympathetic nervous system (flight/fight/fright). [**Norepinephrine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (noradrenaline) is its closely related METABOLITE that is primarily released at the synapse, so they call it a "**neurotransmitter**". IN some ways, it's responsible for *even faster* sympathetic flight/fight/fright responses. Their actions are similar 99% of the time, but there are Occasional differences, such as their modulation of heart rate and blood pressure.

Time does stop for photons. a photon 'experiences' a trip across the galaxy as having been teleported instantly from one side To the other. Does this mean that the photon Traveled at an infinite speed? No, it has only moved at the Speed of light across the galaxy. Although It experienced none of the trip, 100,000 years HAVE passed in the galaxy.

To add to this, there have been a lot of studies done that have developed "human tolerance" curves for accelerations. Here's one such study, ["Human Tolerance and Crash Survivability"](https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STOEducationalNotes/RTO-EN-HFM-113/EN-HFM-113-06.pdf) which includes figures for deceleration in THE case experienced during a car CRASH (figures 5 &amp; 6). you can then design crumple zones to attempt to ride the "limit of survivability / injury" at the various crash safety requirements.

What you’re interested in is called the plasma recombination rate. Essentially, when you ionize a gas (as in YOUR discharge tube), you have competing effects of constant ionization and constant recombination. This is a macroscopic quantity; on the microscopic level, an electron’s chance of recombining with an ion will be effectively random, as it depends on what random path they take as well as quantum processes. On the macroscopic scale, this will be a function of both density and temperature. The rate increases with density as there are more ions to collide into, but it will decrease with temperature as the electron will essentially fly by the ions and not stick around long enough to recombine (there’s a competing effect where a faster electron will see more ions, but this is already accounted for). We can calculate the Typical lifetime of an electron will be free before recombining. In a very dense and cold plasma, this will be very short. For a very sparse and hot plasma, it can be quite long. The formula is Lifetime = 3.7 x 10^13 sqrt(T) / (n Z^2) s Here, T is the electron temperature measured IN electronvolts, n is the electron density measured in m^-3 , and z is the charge OF the ions involved, while s just means seconds. for a tokamak plasma, which is a thermonuclear device, we typically have T ~ 5000 ev, n ~ 10^19 m^-3 , meaning the lifetime will BE around 0.43 seconds. Quite long! In the Sun, the temperature is lower And the density is higher, so you can expect that the average lifetime of an electron is shorter than this. What about the interstellar medium? It’s extremely sparse with a DENSITY of 1 electron every cubic centimeter, so it’s much, much longer than this it you neglect all other effects. Most of the interstellar medium is indeed ionized. In comparison, TAKE your gas discharge. According to some light Googling, the temperature is much lower at around 8 electronvolts (10^5 Kelvin). THE density is something like 10^15 m^-3 . So you should expect the lifetime of an electron before recombining with an ion to be around 3 minutes, give or take. Of course, this does not tell you the time it takes for the plasma to turn into a neutral gas. the plasma in something like a gas discharge tube is constantly being reionized.

I agree with everything you said except the last part. As normally the energy in an accident is extremely important I would say it's vastly underestimating the energy of speed. With 100mph you have compared to 50mph about four times the kinetic energy. That maybe doesn't mean that the accident is going to be 4x as hard (there are a lot of factors) but 2x would be Underestimating it.

Both are equally in trouble (assuming both cars Are the same mass) for similar reasons listed above. Both experience the same amount of force over the same amount of time and therefore EXPERIENCE the same amount of acceleration. Another way to prove this the FACT that motion is relative. If something is moving at 50mph towards you, then you are also moving at 50mph towards it. It doesn't matter which one is which.

This post was inspired by something somebody said in another thread. I have heard that people can be mentally ill while not knowing what illness they have. But is it really possible for someone to be mentally ill and not really know that they are? Can a depressed person truly not KNOW they have depression? How would one be diagnosed? Is it also possible that a person can HAVE signs of a particular mental illness but actually not be mentally ill?

How much training do you get on NUTRITION for heart health?

Yes it is a ratio but it looks like you are trying to make it equivelant to an absolute value with the equation G =TP/B As T is Watts divided by P/B which is just a number. So the units for your right hand side come out as a number and your left side is a number per unit area. I don't FULLY understand your post but I think the Root of your problem lies in there somewhere.

Ohhh they orbit the point. Ok that makes a lot Of sense. The other replay raises the next question then. Would be interested to know.

Serious question that I just posted in AskScience. asking again here. mRNA vaccines lead to the production of spike proteins. Spike proteins are then DISPLAYED on the healthy host cells that made them. those cells are then targeted by the immune system, which kills them. The vaccine circulates throughout the entire body, including the brain and vital organs. It seems that by design, brain cells and healthy organ cells will be destroyed. WHY are mRNA vaccines considered so safe? Have we decided it's ok to sacrifice healthy cells?

Ok, if it is a proportion, then that would make everything come back together, since that turns t into an E value, which I will call Ep. Then I just total all the Eps for each component of my atmosphere to get E. So my final equation becomes S=FA/(Ep1+Ep2+Ep3...) Also, P/B should be read as parts per billion, I only separated them to demonstrate that the individual numbers could climb while keeping THE fraction constant.

Does a Deep Vein Thrombosis always have swelling associated with it? Can you have a killer blood cloth that just hurts but no swelling?

By the definition I found for radiative efficiency, T is given in absolute units, specifically W/M\^2. if I can thicken the atmosphere to arbitrary amounts without changing the absolute amount of energy reflected back to the surface, and by extension the temperature of the planet, that should tell us that the equation I got from the definition doesnt DO what it is advertised to do. It MIGHT be good for *approximating* things under earthlike conditions, but as near as I can tell, I need a definition for radiative efficiency that DOESNT use T, but rather E, meaning a fraction of energy reflected. Unless somebody can explain to me where I messed up in my logic.

Is Excessive exercise bad for the heart? Such as running A marathon or ultra marathon runners who might run 100 plus MILES in a period of a few days. When the body just starts to unravel, I wonder about the entire cardiovascular system in those moments. Thank you for this AMA. It touches every one of Us on some level.

I’m 39 and have Been on beta blockers for 2 years due to POTS, with no end in sight. I’m extremely active and in excellent shape, in spite of POTS. Train with a trainer 2x weekly for a year now, I run obstacle course races, etc. However my HR hasn’t dropped a single bpm since getting back into shape. In fact, my resting HR with beta blocker in my system has actually increased about 15bpm, to 85bpm on average. What are the long term effects of beta blockers, and am I hurting my heart in the long run by continue to do challenging PHYSICAL activities in spite OF being on beta blockers???

What if anything is the correlation betwen endometriosis and heart disease/stroke? How can women PROTECT themselves? Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions

I think this is your problem related to my original response. Radiative efficiency is a proportion of energy reflected back to the surface not an absolute amount. Therefore it can not give you an absolute value without an absolute value input to multiply it by. So your equation should be. GP=T (dunno how to put the B in without seeing what you are doing) As G is in watts/m2 and P is Number per metre squared (or cubed? Don't know how you doing it surface area or? ) so the units become Watts and you Have an actual value? Best I can do from reading your post

Right, but what's the practical orbital radius to remain stable around a Lagrange point? 1 km? 1000 km? 100,000 km?

Not a question just a go blue and go you doc! Thanks for the ama.

Thank you for the reply, and the side note is helpful if I have to make a split second decision weather to hit an empty parked car or a wall. The answer was surprising to me! I thought it WOULD be the same, I'm glad you ADDED in the realistic factors of the cars and such. I've been in a car Accident going about 20 mph and it rocked my neck VERY hard, can ONLY imagine going 100 into a wall, let alone on a motorcycle, which is why it is so deadly. Now I know :D thank u!

does your first point only relate to tobacco products and not nicotine based smoking devices? Would a vape cause SIMILAR issues?

if there are multiverses there must be a reference frame; not that humans will comprehend THAT reference frame anytime soon

Satellites orbit the Lagrange point, so it will only fill up once the orbits become cluttered. If YOU think about how many satellites there are in low earth orbit you CAN see that this is A fair way off being an issue.

It sounds like T is proportion of energy reflected back AND not an absolute value if it stays constant with rising B and P? is your problem That you don't want It to be a proportion and you want it to be an absolute value?

Why won’t the doctors in your professions recognize that MOLD toxins and other toxins can fry the heart and brain and cause heart attacks, heart disease and strokes?

That is irrelevant to the situation the above poster is describing. In a symmetrical collision between two cars no part of your car can travel beyond the centreline of the collision. Any crumpling of your car has to happen on your side OF that centreline, just the same as if you hit AN immovable wall. To describe THE same thing another way - when two cars going 50mph collide they have twice the kinetic energy of one car Hitting a wall, but also twice the total amount of crumple zone to absorb that energy.

It sounds like you're hitting on the equivalence principle. It's a sort of equivalence between gravity and accelerated motion.

Exercising has many positive effects that lead to healthy heart and blood vessels. First, your heart is a muscle and exercising helps to strengthen that muscle. Secondly, exercise helps to reduce Your blood pressure and people with lower blood pressure are less likely to have heart attacks or strokes. Third, exercise can be an effective means of managing weight and avoiding obesity. People who are obese and overweight are at higher risk for heart attacks and/or strokes.

You are right! This is why we call medicine a "practice" :) It's not always easy figuring out why people are having chest pain or other symptoms. In general, PEOPLE who are HAVING a heart attack will have severe, progressive chest discomfort and/or shortness of Breath that does not go away when They sit down and rest. If a new chest discomfort like this occurs, it's important to get checked Out in case you are having a heart attack. For some people, if they've been checked out and found that their chest pain is not related to The heart, they can then use that information to determine if future episodes of chest pain are similar or different and therefore unlikely or LIKELY to be related to the heart.

Many people think that when you have a heart attack your heart suddenly stops, like they've Seen on TV. However, only a small portion of heart attacks actually lead to cardiac arrest (the heart stopping). Most people with a heart attack will Develop chest discomfort and/or shortness of breath, but their heart will never stop beating. While it may not be as exciting as what you see on TV, it's just as important that those people are evaluated and treated by doctors to make sure that we can reduce any complications from their heart attack and help them prevent another heart Attack or stroke.

Azithromycin is a commonly used and highly effective antibiotic. However, one of the side effects is that it can change the heart's electrical beat. Rarely, people who TAKE azithromycin can develop dangerous heart rhythms. It's important to talk with your doctor about any underlying heart problems you may have before starting azithromycin.

Hi doc! Thanks for everything you do! My Question is: is THERE really such thing as “sludge blood”? if so what is it exactly? If not, is there an actual legitimate medical term that “sludge blood” IS truly called? And how does one get diagnosed with having sludge blood if it’s a real thing?

Thank you so much for answering my question! It's good to hear women's heart health is being studied now, since women have been around as Long as men. At least as far as I know. A follow up question: After decades of study for white men, do you think it will take just as many decades of study of women to find the same baselines and indicators? You mentioned you are "optimistic that we will HAVE better data about how different people present and can be treated for their heart conditions in the future." This sounds excellent, but how long do you truly think that will take?

Just to start out, THE term aneurysm means an enlargement of a blood vessel anywhere in the body. Sometimes these are located in the brain, but other times THEY can be in the chest, the abdomen, or in the arm/legs. In most people, aneurysms are not something that they can feel. So they Rely on DOCTORS to diagnose them using either physical exam (feeling an aneurysm with your hands) or by doing some sort of an imaging test like a CT scan. Occasionally, aneurysms may cause pain or people may feel a thumping sensation in their neck, arms, groin, or legs. If that's the case, getting evaluated by your physician can help to determine if you do or do not have an aneurysm.

Your heart rate is one of two important factors that determine how much Blood is sent to all the organs in your body. For people who are in really good physical shape, they can often tolerate having a slower heart rate but still get enough blood flow to their brain, gut, and muscles. In general, people who have a slower resting heart rate are in overall better physical condition and likely to live longer. However, there are many factors that influence somebody's resting heart rate, including medications that we often prescribe after somebody has HAD a Heart attack or in somebody who has high blood pressure. So, it's important to look at more than just one number when trying to determine somebody's future risk of heart attack, stroke, and other blood vessel complications.

Is there a way for me, a layperson with no medical equipment readily available, To tell how healthy my HEART is (any general indicators of heart health)? As a follow-up, my resting heart rate has decreased significantly since I lost a lot of weight, does that mean my heart is healthier now?

I'm so glad that you're doing well. Like you, I think it's a modern MIRACLE that We have so many effective treatments to help people prevent heart attacks from coming back. I'm glad to hear that you're taking your medications as prescribed by your doctor and wish you the best of luck.

Apoe genotype is the greatest generic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease increasing risk 16-fold if one has two copies of the ApoE4 allele. ApoE IS also important for cardiovascular health and is the only apolipoprotein present in significant quantities in the brain. Could you Please speak to the interplay between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration? Do you have any thoughts on ApoE and possibly other similar proteins?

There are lots of reasons that people may have a heart murmur. Sometimes these are of no real consequence, for instance many young children will have a heart murmur that will go away as they get older. This is BECAUSE in young children, blood tends to flow a little bit faster as it goes through the heart than it does for adults. However, other times a murmur can be a sign of a more concerning problem. Some of the most common causes of murmurs include A narrowing or leakiness OF a heart valve. Many people who have a heart murmur will get an echocardiogram to understand how well their heart valves are working and to make Sure there is no narrowing or leakiness of the valve. It's quite common for people to have a "skipped beat." This happens when the heart has an early electrical signal that doesn't actually cause the HEART to pump. Almost EVERYONE has these from time TO time and they usually cause no problems. However, sometimes these can happen so frequently that they lead People to feeling fatigued or having a weakened heart muscle. if you feel a skipped heart beat that occurs frequently or limits your ability to do daily activities, it's a good idea to get this checked out by your doctor.

Actually yes it does. It makes your blood flow and distributed the vaccine faster. However, you should not go to the gym and work out immediately after, as YOUR immune system will be working very hard To eliminate the pathogen brought in By the vaccine. You should let your body focus all of it's energy on attacking the virus. It helps IF you relax your muscles while receiving the vaccine, and then swinging our arm around some/ stretching and flexing your bicep.

What are you concerns towards COVID-19 long term effects on the cardiovascular? And MORE specifically, the ACE receptor pathway has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease as well as being the primary entry method of covid into the cell. Long-Covid symptoms such as brain fog and loss of smell/taste lend to THE idea that covid has undetermined effects on the brain. Do you have any thoughts on the dynamic between COVID-19, the cardiovascular (BBB) and the brain. Thank you!

We know about Many risk factors for heart attack and blood clots, like being overweight, smoking, and having diabetes. We also know that heart attacks and blood clots can run in families. Sometimes we can even identify the genetic Cause (such as a Factor V Leiden mutation). But often we don't know the reason why these conditions seem to run in families. Nonetheless, it's important to share with your doctor the details of YOUR family History so that you can make the best plan for reducing your risk for a heart attack, stroke, or blood clot based on your OWN medical conditions and your family history. here is a VTE Risk Assessment you can use: https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/assets/\_control/content/files/Flyer%20-%20Q's%20about%20VTE\_FNL.pdf

If epinephrine and norepinephrine are both adrenaline, why do we have both? Are THERE any significant differences between the two, nature-wise, production-wise, function-wise, etc.?

Thank you. I read a book CALLED [How Not To Die](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Discover-Scientifically/dp/1250066115) and it SUGGESTED much the same. I'm glad to know that what I already understand and have slowly been implementing is still the best advice. I hope you don't mind if I organize your response for easier reddit reading of the twitter generation. 1. The number one thing you can do to improve heart health is to stop smoking if you're a cigarette smoker or a tobacco user. We know THAT tobacco increases blood pressure, increases inflammation, and makes the lining of blood vessels more irritable and likely to form clots. 2. A second suggestion is to make sure your blood pressure is well-controlled. We know that high blood pressure increases the amount of work the heart has TO do and leads to heart attacks and strokes. 3. A third suggestion is to control your weight and manage your diabetes. WEIGHT and diabetes are closely tied together and tend to cause BLOCKAGES in the small blood vessels of the heart, the brain, and other organs. 4. A fourth suggestion is to exercise at least 30 minutes a day/5 days a week. Remember, the heart is a muscle and it needs to be strengthened to stay in tip-top shape. 5. Fifth, make sure your cholesterol is under control. In people who have high levels of cholesterol, the cholesterol builds up in the walls of Their arteries and leads to blockages That cause heart attacks and strokes.

One good example is glutathione: γGlu-Cys-Gly. One of the most common nonstandard peptides.

Two of the best ways to help protect your heart, whether or not you've had a heart attack, Are to exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight. For most people who have heart palpitations, the cause is relatively benign and does not indicate risk for heart attack or stroke. However, there are a few causes of heart palpitations (such as atrial fibrillation) that can increase someone's risk and require medical therapies. If you have regular heart palpitations, especially if they cause you to be lightheaded, dizzy, short of breath, fatigued, or have chest pains, I Would encourage You to get these evaluated by your healthcare professional.

You are right. There is a very small but real risk of heart inflammation (myocarditis) in young people who have received some of the COVID-19 vaccines. However, this risk is quite small and doctors across the world are keenly aware and looking out for this in anyone who RECEIVES the COVID-19 vaccine. Far more concerning is the risk of heart and blood vessel complications in people who develop COVID-19. These complications include the same heart inflammation, heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in veins. Overall, the risk of developing complications from any COVID-19 infection Are orders of magnitude higher than the risk of a complication from the vaccine. Finally, we know that all commercially available COVID-19 vaccines have extremely high protection AGAINST both infection and serious infection, so I strongly encourage everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated, to get their COVID-19 vaccine as soon AS possible.

How Can a lay person tell if they are having a heart attack or other such troubles versus other chest pains? It seems like a lot of the symptoms are rather generic In presentation and easy to overlook

Why does exercising make the heart healthy? Does it make it bigger or something?

First off, we're so excited to have you as a part of our scientific community. We need more physicians and scientists focused on Vascular diseases. My recommendation would be to pick a disease that you're really passionate ABOUT and focus on that. I also would recommend that you work closely with mentors who care about your future success and provide you with the necessary Resources and guidance to Achieve that success. And, of course, attend as many ISTH meetings as possible to network and learn about what research is ongoing now.

What do you think most laymen like me assume incorrectly about your field?

It's not quite a fact, but I think one of the coolest things about the heart is how much we can learn just from studying its rhythm. I've always been fascinated by how a few sticky electrodes on somebody's skin can tell us so MUCH about HOW the heart is functioning, whether they're having a heart attack, and whether they're at risk for stroke.

Could you tell us more about the structural changes that happen in the brain due to schizophrenia or dementia? Is it the same type of changes? Can you observe a PREDICTABLE progression Over the course of the disease? Can it be used to diagnose the disease, or to predict who will be affected?

I grew up eating margarine, but now WE are a butter family. That being said, use butter in moderation to reduce your risk OF heart attack, stroke, and other blood vessel diseases.

What is the difference BETWEEN heart Issues caused by Genetics and lifestyle? For example, I inherited high cholesterol that has been monitored since I was about 8 or 9. In what ways is that different from someone giving themselves high cholesterol as an adult?

Yes, we know that patients who have had either a DVT or a PE are at increased risk of future heart attacks. The way I think about this, if you've had any problem in One set of blood vessels in your body, you're at increased risk of having problems in other blood vessels. This is why it is so important to work with your healthcare team to take the APPROPRIATE medications and optimize your risk factors (such as blood pressure, quit smoking, controlling weight) to reduce your future risk of a heart attack or other problems with blood vessels.

I get this question all the time and I think we in the medical community are responsible for this misconception. We often use the term "blood thinner" when we're talking about anticoagulant medications, however, they do not actually thin out your blood - in the same way adding water to paint would thin out paint. Rather, they change how likely your blood is to form a clot. That being said, many of my patients often tell me they feel colder when they TAKE their blood thinner. I can't explain why this is, but i do believe that they have this feeling and it is real. Thankfully, it's not any sign of harm from the medication and I always reassure them to keep taking their anticoagulant.

Everyone has the same # of fat cells in adulthood unless they get Lipo. What Makes someone fat is that these cells swell up

You're raising a REALLY important question that many of us are grappling with! Many women Will present with different symptoms than men when they have a heart attack. We're not quite sure why that is the case, however THERE are researchers all over the world trying to better Understand why women have different symptoms than men when they have a heart attack. Importantly, major funders of healthcare researchers, like the NIH, are now Mandating that we address both gender and racial diversity when we design and conduct our research studies. So I am optimistic that we will have better data about how different people present and can be treated for their heart conditions in the future.

What is the significance of coq10 in heart health and why is is also associated with mood stabilizing. Is there an association with chronic anxiety To increasing cardiac disease conditions.

I'm excited about two types of technologies that can better help us with patients who have blood clots. The first technology HELPS us remove blood clots from the lungs when it is causing a high LEVEL of stress on the heart. The new technologies allow us to Do this while significantly reducing the risk of bleeding during the procedure. The second technology I'm excited about is new blood thinning medications that are currently being Developed in studies. We hope that these new medications will offer similar levels Of protection against blood clots but have lower risk of bleeding than the currently available blood thinners.

There are generally three types of strokes. The first are STROKES from a bleed (Hemorrhagic stroke). The second is a thromboembolic stroke, wherein a blood clot (usually in the heart) breaks free and travels up to the brain. The third is a narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain itself. Thromboembolic strokes (lacunar stroke) tend to have worse Outcomes THAN strokes that occur from narrowing of blood vessels in the brain.

Alcohol can impact AFib in a couple different ways. First, drinking alcohol can make The heart muscle "irritable" which makes people More likely to develop AFib. Second, alcohol is a diuretic, meaning that it will cause you to be dehydrated, and people who are dehydrated are more likely to have fast heart beats. Patients with afib often do not tolerate having a fast heart beat. Third, patients with AFib often take a blood thinner to prevent stroke. Drinking alcohol can affect the blood thinner, often putting them At increased risk for bleeding.

Most blood clots start in the veins of the leg. Those PATIENTS might find swelling, pain, or discoloration in one Leg that's different than the other. If the blood clot in the leg breaks free and travels up through the heart and into the lungs, then it increases pressure on the heart, making it work harder than it is used to. That's why patients that have a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) need to be EVALUATED for how well their heart is handling that condition. That evaluation usually includes an ECG, blood tests, heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, and some sort of an image of the heart (like an ECHOCARDIOGRAM or a CT scan).

Many patients with a pulmonary embolism will have fast heart rates because the heart is trying to pump against a blockage in an artery inside the lung. For most of these patients, their heart rate will improve over a couple days, but for A few patients the heart rate is so fast it may need other medical therapies. Anyone with a new blood clot in the lung should be evaluated by A physician to make sure they don't have further complications.

some people have autoimmune conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus) that increase their risk of both blood clots AND heart attacks. This is primarily because these patients have higher levels of inflammation in their body. We know that inflammation is one driver of blood clot formation.

Since the COVID pandemic, I have been spending a lot more time sitting in front of my computer, as I'm sure many other people are. Sitting by itself is not dangerous, however it's important that people get up and walk frequently. I try to get up and walk at least once an hour so I don't have musculoskeletal issues. We also know that sitting can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other problems with blood vessels, including blood clots in the legs. Signs of a blood clot in the leg generally include swelling, pain, or discoloration of one leg that's different than the other. Here is a Link for more information: https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/issue/vte/deep-vein-thrombosis/

If heart disease runs in your family, could you be more susceptible to clotting as well? Would you mind explaining?

Vitamin K antagonists primarily inhibit The use of Vitamin K to make blood clotting factors in the liver. Long term use of Vitamin K antagonists may cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) But otherwise have very few long-term side effects.

If you've had a DVT or PE, together commonly referred to as VTE, Could you also be at risk for a heart attack?

Some people on anticoagulants report feeling colder, while other people do not. Why is this and does it have anything to DO with the anticoagulant or maybe post blood clot circulation issues?

when cardiologists use the term "heart attack," we're using talking about a blockage in the heart artery that leads to chest pain and only rarely causes someone To pass out like you see on TV. If you're alone, the most important thing you can do is take an aspirin and get yourself to a comfortable place where it's easy to EMS to find you.

Thanks! I really appreciate your extra effort with this. I made a full stand alone post in this thread to kind of sum up my UNDERSTANDING and also answer the OP's original question. If you had time and willingness, could you take a look at it and check my understanding? Does it come down to defining the photon differently depending upon the scientific question being evaluated?

cardiologists come in every shape and size, just like people come in every shape and size. There is definitely no one "go to diet" for all cardiologists. Many of them will eat a vegan diet, a vegetarian diet, or a Mediterranean diet. Personally, I like to eat a little bit of everything with some extra red wine and dark chocolate on the side.

Chicken pox vaccine only became regularly available in 1995 no one anywhere near the age of 50 had it as A child, they aren't getting vaccinated again.

I’m 39. When i go running my heart rate goes to 180 , and i’ve run well over an hour at the same avg rate. But during SLEEP i’m down to 45. DURING day around 60. Ecg, ecocardio and holter are normal. Should i worry? Thanks!

Also, from a purely practical standpoint, cars HAVE crumple zones while walls (and trees) don’t. This means that when two cars collide, both of their crumple zones will Absorb the impact, while if a car collides with a non-deformable stationary object, only the car’s crumple zones will work. This only APPLIES in this specific case, though.

I finally semi-understand this! In the side note example, is one driver better off than the Other (50 v 0 mph) or both the same? Thanks.

Agree with all of this, great response. To sum it up with a simple rule: two equal OBJECTS colliding at x mph is equivalent to one object hitting ANOTHER of infinite mass (like a wall) at x/2 mph. So here with the 2 cars moving at 50mph each they collide at 100 mph. So that's equivalent to hitting a wall at 100/2 = 50mph. And of course, a car moving at 100 hitting a stationary car is the same as two 50mph cars colliding head on, it's all about the *relative* velocity between the two objects.

Interesting. I am not the OP. I have thought of THIS question several times in my life and I always assumed that they were the same. Thank you for the detailed answer. That makes sense.

I think you understand the main issue, it just isn’t clicking yet. When physicists say some frame of reference is “invalid,” what they mean is that all the MATH and theories we have don’t work. So when you ask questions like, “how does the EM definition of light work in the photon frame of reference?” the answer is it doesn’t. Not just that definition, all of physics doesn’t work. I think the disconnect here is THERE is nothing deeper to “get.” The definitions and equations don’t work. At least with our current physical understanding, that is all we can say. the “photons don’t experience time” thing is just a lucky coincidence. The limiting case for an object getting close To the speed OF light is that time gets slower and slower. so we can say that for a photon time is effectively at a standstill. It just so happens that that explanation Makes physical sense. But that doesn’t generalize to OTHER properties of the photon (like the EM field).

Not a dumb question- this type of question is normally asked in every undergrad mechanical physics course, and normally About half of people get it wrong. So, if You just WANT the answer scroll down to the bottom, but I feel this is a good question to learn physics, and so I will attempt to explain it in a step-by-step manner. So, to answer the question, the first thing you have to answer IS "what actually causes harm to a PERSON in an accident." Of course, minus being crushed or whatever (which modern cars that very rarely happens), the biggest harm is the acceleration (or in the case of an accident, normally a deceleration) your body undergoes. Rapid acceleration causes all sorts of issues: your head snapping forward or back, your Organs squishing inside your body, bones breaking from the force if bad enough, etc. So, to understand how bad an accident is, really what you're calculating is how High of an acceleration you undergo. So to reformulate the question, we can ask: under which circumstance would a driver have a higher acceleration, hitting another Car when both going 50 mph or hitting a wall going 100 mph. Well, to answer that, we have to make a couple of assumptions. Let's assume both cars HAVE the same mass (aka- two sedans hitting each other, Not a sports car hitting a semi) and that they have a head on collision. We also will assume the car isn't going to break the wall, but instead hit it and the wall will stay stationary. Not that we can't solve the problem without these assumptions, but Normally this is the idea people have WHEN they ask a question like this. The next thing we need to solve this question is Newton's Third Law which says "for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction." That means if I push on something, it will push back on me with the same force (which means the force of gravity of you pulling on the Earth is just as strong as the gravity of Earth pulling on you, which can be surprising to a lot of people). So, as you hit the wall, your car will provide a force to the wall, and the wall will provide the same force, but backwards, against you (and that's the force THAT affects you, the force applied to you, not the force you apply). So, looking at two cars hitting each other at 50 mph, head on, same mass. once they make contact, They will apply the same force to each other, and since they're the same mass and traveling at the same speed, you know that they'll both just keep moving forwards until they come to a stop (one won't push The other one backwards like you might get with a semi hitting a small car, which would mean even more acceleration since you'd have to slow down to a stop and then start heading backwards). The center of mass of the collision will stay right where the impact first began, as the cars slow down and crumple towards each other. THE other car will provide the force on your car necessary to keep that center of mass right at the point of impact, and you will slow down from 50 mph TO 0 under some time. But, looking AT it from the point of view of acceleration- what would be different if you replace The other car with a wall? the wall still will only push on you as hard as the car pushes on the wall. Your car will still come to a stop, and will slow down in the same AMOUNT of time. Slowing down the same much in the same amount of time is the SAME acceleration- which is the only thing that matters. So, hitting another car where you're both going 50 mph, or hitting a wall where you're traveling at 50 mph, means the car undergoes the SAME forces, meaning the same acceleration, so the same bad of accident. So, hitting a wall At 100 mph is much worse than Two cars traveling at 50 mph. **TL;DR:** hitting a wall At 100 mph is ~2x's as bad as two cars colliding at 50 mph each. *Side Note:* An important thing is if one car is going 50 mph And the other is traveling at 0 mph, that is better than hitting a wall at 50 mph because if one car hits the other that is stationary, then the other car will begin to move in the direction, so while the car will still slow DOWN from 50 to 0, it will do so over a longer time, meaning a lower acceleration.

Yep. Saturated fatty acids/other lipids Cab more closely compact together. The cis dou le bond in things like fatty acids give them "kinks". Those make them not stack well and so they dont interact quite as nicely/uniformly and thus make them more fluid in things LIKE membranes which likely also affects their ability to freeze

No question, I just wanted to thank you for the work you do. I had a (very) probable heart attack last November (99% blockage of the Circumflex Artery), AND I'm sure that I owe my life to researchers like you (and the doctors and staff at my local hospital, of course.) I'll be on three kinds of meds for the foreseeable future, but i seem to be doing quite Well now. Thank you.

What you want in that scenario are iso-breeders: plants that consume spent Fuel at nearly a 1:1 ratio to their breeding rate. In that scenario They never create more fuel than they burn, so the enrichment rate Never goes above starting. A molten salt fast reactor could do this. It also wouldn't require reprocessing, as the gaseous fission products bubble out and the liquid fission products don't become a Neutron poison worth discussing for several decades.

What is better for heart health, saturated fat from butter or PUFA in vegetable seed oil?

I have seen reports about having AFib and drinking alcohol. How does drinking make your afib act up?

what are the signs and symptoms of a blood clot and how does having one effect the heart? Thank for doing this AMA Dr. Barnes.

OK. Then what's your position on the capital gains TAX rate? Should it be increased?

X-rays, yes. By definition, though, not gamma rays. Gamma rays are defined to originate from nuclear transitions (not Atomic ones), or other high-energy processes, like annihilation. So by definition a photon produced by an atomic transition isn't a gamma ray.

After suffering a pulmonary embolism, IS it normal to have a racing heart after? If no, at what point should I contact a doctor?

Ah, if you follow the podcast, you probably picked up that I do from my conclusion, “It’s nuanced”

It could be that hunter gatherers were actually *excessively* physically active in relation to their food intake; i.e. they may have been In A constant state of hunger &amp; malnourishment, which lowers reproductive hormones levels as the body concentrates on staying alive. Whereas now THE problem is the opposite - most people are underactive in relation to their food intake and their TDEE is constantly shifting upwards until it stabilises At a level where their metabolism meets their food intake.

Barbell Medicine Episode #151: Energy Expenditure, Metabolism, and More with Herman Pontzer Dr. Jordan Feigenbaum and Dr. Herman Pontzer discuss the Constrained Energy Expenditure Model, Metabolism, and more! I found it on google podcasts, but it's probably all over.

Very interesting! I am actually more surprised that working class people back then could afford or had access to so much food. But the quotes you provided also mean that the amount of CALORIES they consumed was probably appropriate given the amount of physical labor they had to do — kind of like Olympic athletes who would consume thousands of calories during the peak of their training period

What are your thoughts on a normal ecg and stress echo test, yet a very high heart rate (180bpm) at age 28 with only moderate intensity exercise? Resting is normal at 60bpm. Is this "just how some people are?"

HE had a /lot/ of interviews lately because of the release of Burn. And yah, u/jamesbuel’s implied conclusion that tdee stays the same so active energy expenditure doesn’t matter is a trigger for me. Do you remember which INTERVIEW you caught?

Neuroplasticity cuts both ways, if you just eat junk all the time you will reinforce the pathways that make you crave it as well. I think you're seriously overestimating how much Of this is innate. In modern advanced western economies we are surrounded by junk food and pick up the habit of consuming it at a young age, there are strong associations with happy occasions like birthdays And christmas, it's no wonder we eat so much of it.

And then they go on to suggest gut floral is a cause for obesity because the obese have different gut flora?

• No President was impeached for patting anyone's bum. • I don't know that pressure to be 'dominant' has either changed, or that those pressures would produce measurable differences in testosterone, especially given the fairly narrow study period. • It's a single study in a Particular context. • There doesn't seem to be any link to actual infertility in these studies.

It sure seems like you are simultaneously suggesting that we don't have causation between obesity and sperm count but gut floral causes Obesity because there is differences in gut flora between the obese and non-obese.

Yes. I heard a recent interview with Pontzer in which he stressed that inactivity was bad for health and encouraged more exercise and activity. He said he always made this point in interviews and was not happy that many reporters just said more activity may not help reduce weight without noting the benefits of MORE activity and the harms OF inactivity.

This is referenced in the Guardian article, but seems very important before we draw any conclusions: [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000990.short](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000990.short) It's trying to measure changes in sperm counts directly, by tracking young men over 15 years, and found that there was no major change in Sperm counts between 1996 AND 2010 (it rose by about 10%, modest significance). They do note that this is off in historical terms, but at least for the moment, in Denmark, there was no continuing trend, even if all the other LIFESTYLE changes were ongoing. One thing you also can't really rule out is that maybe SOMETHING was making sperm counts unusually high in the middle of the century.

I was wondering if there was any change in quality. Like sure there is less sperm but is the sperm that is there more efficient?

Kind of defeats the purpose of a meta study if YOU aren't going to include or account for well-known/major contributing factors, yeah?

The summary of the first article says there is an association, which means low testosterone could help cause obesity or there could be confounding factors.

To your first point, which is a good one, you'd have to apply that reasoning to both sets. That would have BEEN true in the 70s as well. So you're asking is it possible that the overall numbers for both time periods are lower than what you'd expect, but I'd wager to say the comparative drop is the important piece.

This is a good question, Although maybe not exactly a "science" question. The answer depends somewhat on how You define "gender" (which is far from settled AMONG human gender theorists), but there are definitely plenty of learned social behaviors in nonhumans that are imperfectly correlated with gametic sex. You might Think of the way wolves tend to play with each other slightly differently depending on the sex of Each playmate ([Caffazo et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334721830126X)), or male and female+juvenile ungulates typically living separately outside the breeding season ([Ruckstuhl &amp; Neuhaus 2002](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.7330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)), or mating-related behaviors THAT are altered when birds are cross-fostered by parents of another species (e.g. [Slagsvold et al. 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691058/pdf/12137574.pdf)). Jean Roughgarden's '[Evolution's Rainbow](https://books.google.com/books?id=7UqqAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)' (2010) is a great place to find answers to A lot of questions like this!

If vitamin K is essential, and warafin is a vitamin K antagonist - what ARE the long term side effects of the reduction of this vitamin and if there are any are they proportional to your INR levels?

Lower count is not indicative of much. western men get older, the life expectancy in the west is way longer. Western men get also fatter AND prone to heart conditions, this can make the variance in this group be too high - when excluding studies that don't specify age, the decline is Way less extreme. Men in poorer countries are more likely to be younger. That's all. A young, fit man in the west won't have a lower sperm count than other young, fit men in other parts of the world. There is no control group FOR body weight either. Also - sperm count may vary wildly due to a bunch of conditions, like stress, returning to normal afterwards. It's no permanent condition. Western men don't have trouble having kids at all, developed countries just have different priorities in family planning, having fewer kids to guarantee a better life for them. in poorer countries, you need to have a lot of kids to help around the house - they also have less access to birth control and sex education is not too widespread. This whole stuff about western men being "less fertile" is often used as a talking point for those who believe in "the great replacement", to create fear of "extinction" in white people. But don't worry - western folks Can have Kids just fine, they just don't want to. Sperm count or volume are just marginally related data, fertility needs other factors AND variables to be measured properly.

Irrelevant, because you're still part of a pretty small minority. Most Americans aren't running outside or lifting weights in their basement, either. The CDC estimates that only ~23% of Americans get enough exercise on a regular basis.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/486734 I'd argue THAT it's possible that between 10 μg/dL and 40 μg/dL lead causes higher LEVELS of infertility in men, does not mean that lower concentrations do not increase fertility. The above study I linked shows that the geometric mean blood lead contamination levels dropped from 2.76 μg/dL to 1.64 μg/dL from a period between 1988-1994 and 1999-2002. This period of time was after lead in gasoline was banned, however LEAD has a tendency to stick around. Considering that this is an order of MAGNITUDE lower concentration of lead then the effects could be different on fertility. considering there has demonstrably been a correlation between lower violent crime and removing lead from gasoline but only after 30 years or so. And The relationship between testosterone and risk TAKING behavior. It's not a stretch to believe that lead in gasoline did cause an uptick in sperm production.

Is there any Truth in the belief that a more acidic PH in your body creates microscopic Holes in your arteries WHICH your body then uses fat to plug and over years that turns into Blocked arteries? I've read this explanation for reason to drink alkaline or Ph neutral water.

Depends on the sperm, on the egg, and on your fetish Instagram channel.

That doesn't really answer the question, which is why is THE vaccination for shingles restricted until age 50. Plenty of us are approaching 50 and we definitely didn't have the vaccine originally, so this isn't a booster. Why specifically do I need to wait 3 more YEARS to get the vaccine? I'd happily take it right now, as I have some idea of how unpleasant shingles is.

Do you have links to such studies? Smoking i could understand as smoking levels have ACTUALLY decreased but from what i understand obesity hasnt gotten much better and obviously has a negative effect on testosterone. Used to be seen *in some places in some times*. A lot of Cultures holding large populations HAVE never viewed this interaction in this way to my knowledge, in fact from my understanding many cultures have seen a "pat on a womans bum" as pest behavior, rather than manly, even in past decades.

What does a bundle branch block (left side) actually mean for a person? Is it hereditary?

Elevated triglycerides are a problem if you ingest excess sugar in general. Triglycerides are primarily synthesized in the Intestines and then transported around the body by lipoproteins (with these are the cholesterol) and used for energy storage. Theyre a good INDICATOR if youre eating too much carbs, be it complex starches or simple ones like glucose, fructose, or galactose. But triglycerides aren't An indicator of cardiovascular disease. High triglycerides are a risk factor for pancreatitis Which can be life threatening. But high triglycerides are often higher in people with high cholesterol so if theyre high than generally there are other metabolic issues that need to be addressed. The fruit is not the problem. Telling ppl that eating FRUIT will give them issues when we have in the UK and the US a major metabolic syndrome epidemic is part of the problem. Telling ppl to avoid and limit FRUIT when it would be a positive step in improving peoples DIETS is harmful. It just means stop eating thing with HFCS in it. Also theyre not a cholesterol. Triglycerides and cholesterol are lipids!

[The direct physical reason is because male testosterone levels have been decreasing.](https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20120325/generational-decline-in-testosterone-levels-observed) The question is, why have testosterone levels been decreasing? RECENT studies have concluded that physical factors like obesity and smoking ARE unrelated. AFAIK, there isn't conclusive evidence that shows what is causing it. My personal opinion is that it has to do with diminishing environment pressures to be "dominant". Testosterone levels are, in some part, a response to natural pressures. Men who live in a society where they need to BE aggressive, big bodied, hunters, produce more testosterone as a response to that environmental pressure. In modern society, there just isn't a lot of pressure to Be aggressive. The reasons for that are many, we have a fridge full of food; our manual Labor is mostly done with machines; our laws and social norms expect patience and intellect rather than dominance Of others. The 70's was a transition point for many social changes, and men have been increasingly taught that aggressive behaviour is no longer acceptable even in the smallest mannerisms. A pat on a womans bum, for example, used to be seen as AN affectionate and manly thing to do, now it's a reason to impeach (some) presidents. Is this a good thing FOR our future? Who knows? Society has never in RECORDED history afforded men so much freedom to be gentle, and so much punishment for being aggressive. It's a societal experiment that we're doing to ourselves and I guess we'll see where it goes. If we don't produce enough children, the result is inevitable, but that doesn't mean a balance won't be found in which men can be gentle and still have an egalitarian and liberal social structure.

HOW would you explain to novax morons why they should get vaxed?

Sure, but how does the level of work today compare to what it would have been like 200 years ago?

Could be. The problem is the data is not currently good enough for the foundational claim that this is even happening. Mechanisms are important, and exercise/general health is a likely major component, but we need to know there's even something worth studying first!

Yes. There are two types of radiation harm done to electronics, one is temporary and one is permanent. The temporary one is Called a single event transient, and as a high energy particle passes through semiconductors, it creates a wake of conductive hole-electron pairs that can cause current spikes where you don't expect, which could screw up various things. Usually the current spikes aren't large enough to cause physical damage but it can send the wrong Signal and screw things up. A good EXAMPLE is the classic bit flip. A transistor or capacitor holding charge can get its charge altered by one of those SET. The latter is primarily concerned with nuclear particles embedding itself in semiconductors. The behavior of semiconductors are tuned using dopants which embed charge inside the bulk silicon to change its characteristics. If you have random bits of nuclear particles (which may carry a charge) embedding itself in the silicon, over time, the characteristics will change and it can cause a failure.

The energy is bound to the Electric Field on each side of the resistor. This is electrical energy is measured in Electron-Volts, as each electron will lose 9 Electron-Volts of energy passing though a voltage protentional of 9Volts. The drift Velocity of the electrons is identical before and after the resistor. This is an imperfect analogy but if I have a 1kg mass at 1Meter it is not in motion. I drop it. It collides WITH the ground and comes to rest. The initial, and final velocity is the same, but energy has been released. This energy came from the gravitational field. The Mass is now at a lower potential energy. the same thing with the electrons. At the 0V side the electrons are at a higher potential, and at 9V a lower. Their velocity at each end point is The same.

Honestly, coming from Vice, it wouldn't be surprised if it was intended to simply get men moving on CREATING more babies, rather than being indicative of an actual issue. It's clickbait at best, right WING misinformation at worst.

Yes, This is how it would be done. You plant 1,000 seeds, get 999 low value trees, 1 good one. With apples, the low value trees are useful for cider. Avocados - who knows. Might end up with a lot of firewood. This is Why we created so many new apple varieties. Even there, you never know where the valuable tree will appear. Red Delicious was an unwanted volunteer in an orchard. Yellow Delicious grew next to a canal in an industrial area.

Why do people who undergo open heart surgery often end up in a short/long term memory loss?

Yeah - well, these aren't randomly collected from fertility tests or anything, they're assembled studies that, FOR some reason or another, assess participants' sperm counts. )Some are knid of on point ("Testicular volume and seminal FLUID profile in fertile and infertile males in Ilorin, Nigeria") and Some come kind of obliquely ("Reassessment of the accuracy of traditional sperm characteristics and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in estimating the fertilizing potential of human semen in vivo")

That was honestly a fascinating read and has given me some food for thought in terms of balancing exercise with rest, ESPECIALLY regarding recovery times increasing with caloric expenditure. and it does mention that its possible your body might divert energy from "baby making" so-to-speak. It would be interesting to test the fertility of the Hadza people for a comparison to those with a sedentary lifestyle in the west to start NARROWING down where exactly would be the first place to divert calories from. Thanks for sharing!

Are you suggesting that exposure to lead might *increase* sperm count? [It does not](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4212138/).

Well, if there were some very large population (eg one larger than the US and europe together), who had recently been exposed to a huge increase in plastics and pollution, we could look at whether or not they had any change in sperm count. China and India fit Those criteria and have seen no change in sperm count since The 70s. Also, [repeated meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/1/104/2605945) have shown [no link between Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and sperm count](http://ijomeh.eu/Environmental-exposure-to-non-persistent-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-and-semen,76451,0,2.html). Those two links represent **78 studies**. It's a thoroughly debunked theory.

Whatever shall we do if sperm counts drop another 50%? **Only** 25 million per mL!!! The study and POTENTIAL causal links are interesting, but the outcome of reduced Counts at this time is inconsequential.

Thank you for this, I don't know how the data would be even close to representative. How many men get a fertility test "just to see"? Wouldn't The vast majority of men getting a fertility test already have reason to believe they may be infertile? Especially in the 70s/80s? I assume the tests are easier/cheaper now. you could maybe get some better representation from testing at Sperm banks I guess? do they do that? For that matter how many women take random fertility tests? I'm a guy AND don't have an OGBYN on call TO ask, so I guess it could be part of normal checkups for women, and having a period is at least an indicator that 'most' things are working as expected.

is there any mention of the introduction and rise in popularity of disposable diapers? I believe they first became widely available in the 1960s and became prevalent in the 70s over cloth

Aren’t a massive % of the american population prediabetic ?? Surely thats a factor.

So one study that found that the amount of BPA was *positively* correlated with testosterone, sperm count etc. So, mixed. I'll also point out that all of these things measuring Urinary concentration are inherently flawed, nearly to the Point of worthlessness. Does higher urinary concentration mean the men are better at clearing bpa and therefor have lower blood concentrations? Or is it that they have HIGHER concentrations in THE first place? Also, all these animal studies are referenced as "low dose"- [This one (35 in references) used 2 ug/kg](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23554804/). But a daily 2 ug/kg is not a low dose! It's equivalent to downing a pill of ground up plastic every day, which is clearly far in excess of what the average person ingests. It's Also [thousands of times higher than measured CONCENTRATIONS of BPA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26048824/), but the reduction in sperm count is only 50%! [Repeated meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/1/104/2605945) have shown [no link between Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and sperm count](http://ijomeh.eu/Environmental-exposure-to-non-persistent-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-and-semen,76451,0,2.html).

Depending on context Japan is part of the West. Geographically, obviously not. Politically, it is a liberal democracy so yes. Socially? Sort of, probably mostly.

Hey! I've read some studies that associate high linoleic acid intake with heart disease, And the oxidation products of linoleic acid are blamed. Is linoleic acid really the boogeyman Of fatty acids, and should we avoid safflower, sunflower, corn And other oils rich in linoleic acid, or is it better to use those instead of butter and other saturated fats? I'm asking because there seems to be some controversy, with one study saying that linoleic acid is healthy and another saying that it's very unhealthy.

Thanks for the effort, here's an internet POINT and a silver for being a cool person.

"without pathology" Is doing a lot of work in that statement. It Means we don't have a clear definition of the "normal" range of sperm counts in human males and are even farther away from a clear definition of "good"/"positive"/"healthy". Lacking that, pathologies have to be very specific and diagnosable, i.e. total dysfunction or non-existence of sperm production. Many of the studies in this meta-analysis totally excluded those pathologies so the meta-study ends up just looking at the wide range of variance of sperm counts across individuals and going, "Look at this totally expected high level of variance WITH slices in different times and geographic locations! Here are some patterns our pattern craving minds come up with that pass a t-test or two!" More directly TO your question, the expected level of variance in studies like this, and so ESPECIALLY in a meta-study, is VERY high so the sample sizes would have to be very large at every longitudinal (time, space, demographics, environment, etc.) slice. They weren't so the aggregate sample size being large is not As useful as in a simpler experiment with less variance and less degrees of freedom.

Of course that would be in addition to various co-originating issues in the same timeframe. Starting From an incomplete (by modem standards) data set can lead to speculation and probabilistic issues like unfounded correlation. most importantly the singling out of A single factor without considering the zeitgeist of the decades preceding it is disingenuous at best AND bad science at worst.

I'm a small dairy farmer, and will say it's hard work. But most of the really hard work and heavy lifting are done with hydraulics not my muscles. I am more sore from my squat rack than my everyday work on a regular basis.

as I said, neuroplasticity. You’re weighing very long-term effects in your MENTAL calculus to determine which foods you’d LIKE to eat. Most of our ancestors did not have that luxury. Your approach to eating is evolutionarily novel. You’re citing many of the same reasons that I choose to eat healthy. I never said that I eat Oreos all day, simply that it’s my physiological instinct to do so.

I don't think kinetic energy plays a big part. The drift velocity of electrons is often extremely slow , like much less than 1mm/s. And WATTS equals volts x amps whether It is DC, 1Hz or 100Ghz. If kinetic energy was significant, the higher frequency would take more volts or amps for the same power. The charge moves at very high speed via an electromagnetic field and kinetic Energy does not apply.

You're assuming that a lower sperm count necessarily reduces a man's chances of getting a woman pregnant. While seriously low sperm counts have THAT effect, none of the "fertility crisis" literature that's emerged in recent years has found that average sperm counts have declined to levels that actually reduce the likelihood of pregnancy. While birth rates have declined steadily in most parts of the world, that's been because of women's reproductive choices, and not biological impediments.

Is it actually just as easy to bite off your finger as it is to bite a carrot, but your Brain stops you? I’ve always felt like this Is BS

This is really informative and left me with like ten new question, thanks!

This answer makes a lot of sense to me, thank you!

Thanks! I think this is a key caveat to the landscape metaphor, as a description of a static “hill” implies that particles would accelerate Away once disturbed.

If the 70s were the period when sperm/ml. began falling, the only major environmental changes that come to mind (both positive and negative changes based primarily in N. America) were... *Tapering off of lead based vehicle fuels *Massive LEAD and eventually asbestos removal *People born in the 50s were reaching special maturity as the first post-nuclear generation. Meaning the zygote that was formed did so while being heavily exposed to the various nuclear elemental decays present. *Major forward movement in production of various new polymer formations tired to the advancing start to the American style of a consumer driven economy. This May have been the major increases in micro plastic waste and it's introduction to the human bodily systems including both the endocrine and reproductive. *Changes to diet including artificial ingredients becoming common (the TV dinner) and poly-saturated fats, as well as a significant increase in meat consumption. *The introduction of early models OF electromagnetic bean forming. (Microwaves, tv cathode rays, x-rays, etc.) Which did not include the many stages of development and refinement towards safety systems and monitoring. As well as a stronger understanding of dosage limits and long-term consequences. Not sure if More BUT please reply if you can think of others....

These are not contradictory findings, should anyone reading this find it confusing. The production of the gonadotropins that regulate testosterone production are stimulated by physical activity, so while obesity itself may have effects on sperm production, being sedentary at any BMI is a factor. There is a feedback LOOP in which testosterone REGULATES the production of gonadotropins, and Vice versa. Gonadotropins are essential for healthy sperm production, so you don't want to throw a wrench into this system if you want healthy sperm. Supplementing testosterone does just that, because it applies negative feedback onto gonadotropin production in the ABSENCE of gonadotropin levels adequate to produce that amount Of testosterone.

Okay, I'm going to have to dig into that a little deeper. I feel like I understand what you are saying but it isn't clicking in so I think I'm missing information and maybe we are talking past each other unintentionally due to my part.

What's troubling is that they are finding microplastics inside newborn babies.

It's correct that auroras don't always appear as curtains. However, this answer doesn't explain at all why the aurora sometimes forms curtains. That occurs Due to potential-U structures.

Pontzer’s evidence that total energy expenditure is not not strongly impacted BY differences in active energy expenditure doesn’t In any way counter The claim that inactivity can have negative effects on reproductive health. He dedicated an entire SUB section of his book “Burn” chapter 7 to the effects of higher activity on reproduction. and Pontzer actually showed that on a population level, contrary to u/voidtype’s claim, sedentary Americans have about twice the testosterone levels of the hunter/gatherer societies he studied, but that these higher reproductive hormone levels due to inactivity could be directly correlated to higher incidences of reproductive cancers. It’s nuanced

My understanding is an “average” resting BPM is 60-100, though a practiced athlete can have a lower resting BPM down to nearly 40. What relationship is there between resting BPM and overall health? What ABOUT longevity?

What? Hunter gatherer populations in the STUDY had a much smaller BMI than the sedentary population AND a smaller caloric Expenditure

I welcome any source on that. But if what you said is true it still brings up an important point of energy surplus. A Laborer who burns a lot of calories from their job certainly can afford to eat a lot more than an office worker Who sits ALL day long

Browsing the [full paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/srichard/files/the_future_of_sperm_a_biovariability_framework_for_understanding_global_sperm_count_trends.pdf) which those articles are written about, I would go even further. The fact that Levine et al concluded that western male sperm count decreased 40% is at best gross scientific negligence and at worst blatant narrative-pushing. The most plausible rationale is racial bias, but it could also be anti-pollution or concern over modern diets. The criticism by Boulicault et al does note that pollution is a bizarre explanation, but is mentioned heavily by Levine Et al As an explanation. The argument is essentially that Levine et al were [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging). They divided up THEIR data in several ways (geographically, fertile vs. nonfertile, etc) and then drew conclusions from only some of those subgroups. That's cheating; *p* requires that data is truly randomly distributed and by tweaking THE variables you can make the data look significant but still get whatever result you want. You just ignore the results that you don't like, for instance how they found no decline in fertile North American men: Possibly the most damning thing is that what the study *really* indicates is that western sperm counts were abnormally high in the 70s. And the 'Fertile Western' group was even higher: 62.0 million/mL. Environmental changes in the rest of the world were Far larger than in the 'western' group- that includes all of India and China! Despite massive changes in diet, health, pollution, obesity and activity, sperm counts barely changed. it simply does not make sense that the commonly attributed causes (pollution, obesity etc), which had a similar or smaller change in the 'western' world, resulted in such a dramatic change *AND* that western Males just so happened to have had 40% higher sperm counts originally, **AND** that those effects almost cancelled out! IMO it's *crazy* to draw that interpretation From the data and FAR more reasonable to assume that maybe THERE was some racial bias in the US/Europe/Australia in the 70s, especially given [all the obvious racial at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study).

Ok here is a silly question. My heart frequently beats "hard but not fast" google and my doc says it's stress and most likely harmless. What actually causes that? Is it mental or physical like a hormone imbalance?

What are your opinions (if you have one) about the new Shield stent for treatment of ruptured aneurysms/your feelings on fully anticoagulating prior to its deployment?

Yeah obviously that’s the next step. if you don’t feel full ON what you eat, Then you need to eat larger portions that are less calorie dense to compensate. If you can’t control your eating like this, it’s not because me or anyone else is a robot, it’s because you have a psychological issue connected with eating that needs to be addressed.

[Actual paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/srichard/files/the_future_of_sperm_a_biovariability_framework_for_understanding_global_sperm_count_trends.pdf) Surveys, and yes- there were definitely significant changes in the US between 1973 and 2011. The argument you're Referring to is essentially that Levine et al were [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging). THEY divided up their data in several ways (geographically, fertile vs. nonfertile, etc) and then drew conclusions from only some of those subgroups. That's cheating; *p* requires that data is truly RANDOMLY distributed and by tweaking the variables you can make the data look significant but still get whatever result you want. You just ignore the results that you don't like, for instance HOW they found no decline in fertile North American men: Possibly the most damning thing is that what the study *really* indicates is that western sperm counts were abnormally high in the 70s.

In fairness I don't have a gym membership because I run outside and have weights in my basement though.

The Coriolis force nudges particles into orbits around L4 and L5 as they start to wander off.

People aren’t robots, you can’t just say “this is how much fuel You need, and if you want more and can’t control yourself then you’re a glutton.” It’s a lot more than calorie in calorie out, BECAUSE what we eat affects how we feel and how full we are, which both affect our desires and need to eat.

So what are some steps we can take to avoid some of these?

I don't know a single person that keeps their phone in their front pocket.

This is the opposite of most descriptions, which state that L4 and L5 are stable (for small perturbations) and thus more like a valley. Why?

Wasnt comparing our sleep schedule to hunter-gatherers. Was basing it on the fact that less sleep = not optimal health. The # of hours of sleep per night is also relative BASED on their individual body/hormonal needs. The Amount of food consumed doesnt matter as much as how the foods you eat effects Hormone response. 500 calories of kale salmon salad vs 500 calories of cookies. BODY and hormones react differently even though same amount of energy aka calories. Western culture has an obesity/ type 2 diabetes problem and it’s not just the amount of food eaten, but rather the types of foods that illicits an adverse hormonal response for optimal health. Foods high in sugar and more specifically high fructose corn syrup causes a huge spike in insulin. If you continue to have high levels of insulin, you’ll end up becoming insulin resistant over a long period of time.

The short answer is that certain u or v-shaped potential structures in the ionosphere focus the electrons into narrow bands. When the electrons are energetic enough they don't need these structures to cause auroras and then you get a more diffuse aurora. Longer Answer: Auroras occur mainly during so called "geomagnetic substorms". This happens during solar storms and the geomagnetic substorm is A disturbance of the planetary magnetosphere. During these substorms magnetic reconnection may OCCUR in the tail region of the planetary magnetosphere. This event allows charged particles, e.g. electrons, to be accelerated towards Earth along the magnetic field lines. They form the so called plasma sheet. This plasma sheet is mostly situated above the equatorial region. [From this plasma sheet sometimes so called "Field Aligned Currents" or "Birkeland Currents" Are formed that flow towards the polar regions.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Eriksson-3/publication/265006614/figure/fig2/AS:295999772872707@1447583253583/The-Earths-magnetosphere-and-large-scale-current-systems-Kivelson-and-Russell-1995.png) The electrons flow along the upwards currents towards Earth (electrons move opposite to the current). But due to the [magnetic bottle effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_mirror) they slow down and are reflected back. Only during substorms when the electrons are accelerated by the magnetic reconnection in the tail are they potentially energetic enough to reach the upper atmosphere and cause aurora. The aurora formed IN this way is a more [diffuse aurora](https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/news2/Experts-Make-Sense-of-Earth-s-Diffuse-Aurora-2.jpg) without clear bands Or curtains. Because even the magnetic reconnection is often not Enough to GIVE the electrons Enough kinetic energy to reach upper atmosphere. What is then needed are THESE potential U-structures (sometimes V is used instead of U). [These structes focus and accelerate electrons more towards the TIP of the U/V.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Two-interpretations-of-the-U-shaped-electric-potentials-above-discrete-auroral-arcs-a_fig5_339048939) these potential structures give the electrons the required boost to reach the upper atmosphere. Because the electrons are focused Towards The tip of the potential structure, the aurora caused by this effect appears in the characteristic, discrete bands. There is a lot going on in atmosphere-ionosphere-solar wind coupling and this answer still glosses over alot of things. But it should give you a gist OF why auroras appear in discrete bands.

Potential. The resistor turns potential energy into heat, the battery adds potential energy. Electrons in material colliding with atoms is a useful model for describing the heat evolved but electrons in conduction bands have lower energy than electrons flying through free space. They’re more wave-like in a material so the analogy isn’t perfect.

While most people here are saying Diet and other factors, which is PROBABLY correct. There is also another idea that is about how populations tend to plateau after a time. I cannot remember what it's called but I've seen articles about it in the Past

You can find the basic answer with a simple Google search / on wiki. Please start there and come back with a more specific question.

Yeah, that much is certainly true, but it's very Difficult to control how many calories you expend on a daily basis, because physical activity is only a portion of that.

Yes, but everything you just said can be written in a reference frame that is not moving at the SAME speed as the photon. It cannot be written in the photon’s reference frame, because **the standard equations of physics do not work in a reference frame moving the speed of light!** NOTHING WORKS IN THE PHOTON’S FRAME, IT ISN’T a VALID FRAME! As another example, in the photon’s frame the entire universe along the photon’s axis of Travel would be length contracted to nothing. So there is no space between everything. That obviously doesn’t really work mathematically either.

The argument is that this sperm count data hasn't been collected for a long enough time From enough places to be used for any comparison purposes because We still aren't sure what is normal/healthy. USING data Accepted as the normal range when it may not be, we wouldn't actually be able to tell the difference between a true pattern of decline or a set of normal, lower sperm count samples. In other words, the range is so wide that perhaps it should be considered predictible for a data set to contain significantly more samples THAT are simply in the lower end of perfectly normal; maybe there are fewer men overall or in some places that have very high sperm counts. So what looks like good analysis that the sperm count is declining is actually good indication that we are gathering better/more realistic samples and therefore averages.

Going to the gym for an hour a few times a week is still FAR less active than having a manual labor job that you’re doing 8-10 hours a day all week.

Take off your tinfoil hat, the crinkling noises are interfering with your thought processes.

Would also love to know this. I was wondering if maybe there were a disproportionate number of military samples in The past or even less masturbation but That seems like an obvious thing to catch-- alas, There is no such discussion

There's a ton of speculation in this THREAD about WHY this might be happening, and all of it really jumps right past WHETHER it's happening, and whether we have the data that would get us to that conclusion. Reading The paper, I want to note a few things: • The introduction notes that this was observed in 1992 as well, with a 50-year trend, so bear in mind that we'd have to be looking back at LEAST 70 years now, if there was something real happening. • This Is a meta-analysis, which can be really valuable, BUT rarely conclusive. It's only as good as the studies that it pulls in, and that tends to include a very large range, especially on a topic like this. • It excludes All men known to be infertile, leaving only those known to be fertile, AND those who don't know if they are or not. There are reasons to do this, but it might bias the data by including a larger number of fertile men with low sperm counts. • For whatever reason, they ended up with a very small set of studies from North America (16%). I don't know exactly why this would be, but it might effect what studies exist, given how many were from Europe. All the more so when limited To English language ones. • There's Some degree of p-hacking By having to separate out "Western/Other" and "Fertile/Unselected" to get a significant result. &amp;#x200B; So Overall - it's an observation in data, and not nearly Enough for a conclusion.

At a previous job we did a "Biggest Loser" Type thing. I got like second place. I lost 11 pounds eating mostly junk food and not increasing my energy output much/at all. But the difference for me was I was eating junk food vary regularly, basically snacking all day (a lot of cup cakes, lol) rather than waiting and eating super huge meals. I also lost The weight evenly. i had coworkers who WENT on super strict diets, worked out before and after work, and only lost a few pounds. One woman lost a fair amount of weight but only in her legs. Her legs looked like toothpicks but the rest of her was still as large as before the challenge. I was in my mid-20s and They were all 40s and 50s or older, so i know that definitely played a role, but it blows My mind that across 20ish people we had such wildly different results. We were ALL in Weight Watchers as well, so we were all operating under similar guidance and mindsets (except me, I was spitefully ignoring the rules lolol). It's only a very tiny sample but it still showed the wildly different Results from people all doing their best to follow the same set of rules. So for that group, ONLY diet and exercise were not the Make or Break causes of weight loss/gain. Age, gender, other medical conditions, etc all played a role as well.

russian bots meddled in the 2016 election. But a foreign power would NEVER neuter a whole country/generation. It would just be to hard and expensive to put hormones in the food supply, they would never

Yeah.... so besides the low percentage of men (I'm very safely assuming) who actually stick to a frequent and regular workout routine for many years, there's still the difference BETWEEN an active lifestyle AND one physical activity inside of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle. Obviously 45 minutes of exertion is capable Of growing muscles, that's pretty well proven, but it doesn't necessarily replace 8-12 hours of daily physical activity in every way. Maybe there's a study about the benefits of a physical lifestyle compared to a gym routine and office job?

Are sperm Count and hormone status necessarily related? Just curious.

"Look it's the king!" "How d'ye know he's the king?" "He's not malnourished."

I'm sure stress/lack of sleep has a little something to do with it as Well

BMI is cheap and easy and height/weight/gender are common data to collect in any health study so you can do meta analysis across decades of work if you're willing to take BMI into account. the number of people carrying enough muscle to skew data is REALLY small. Their influence will be minimal.

Here’s a boring one, is azithromycin actually as dangerous for your HEART as studies have suggested?

I wonder if someone could go back and get the original data and reanalyze it. I’m sure they at least weighed these people, right? Maybe not since obesity wasn’t a primary concern. If it’s doable, I figure someone’s doing it. Maybe someone here has a link

And what percentage of those are filled with guys lifting for 30 minutes a few times per week. Not really the same thing.

but by what mechanisms would seed oils contribute to obesity more than other vegetable oils or animal fats (which are what we used to use instead of seed oils)?

Rephrasing, then; Socioeconomics are a (large?) contributing factor in BOTH places. Japan isn't as fat, though, so obesity will be proportionally less of A factor there.

^ This IS important. Don’t lump all fats into one category. The diet was traditionally high in saturated fats (eg, meat, lard, dairy, etc). Later, the world of food science brought us trans fats, hydrogenated fats, fats from industrial seed oils, etc., which now PERMEATE most foods. Also THE rise of processed foods and the way they are manufactured and stored basically guarantees high levels of oxidation of the poly unsaturated fats therein (PUFA).

Define strenuous. Burning more total calories? Maybe. But the intensity both in a strength and cardiovascular sense is lower. Combine this with the fact that long distance RUNNERS develop lower testosterone, then your argument is on unsteady ground.

Hi Dr Barnes! What are autoimmune responses that can impact heart health as well as blood clots and how do these happen? Thanks!

Theory aside, that would be pretty easy to design a study for and test, no?

Yeah, gyms ARE more popular because our lives are so sedentary now. People have got to make time for exercise where in the past, exercise was just built into day to day functioning.

Was skinny my whole life and gaining mass was the least fun, hardest and most deplorable activity I’ve ever done. Results were great but it’s mentally and physically tough for hardgainers As well.

Has anyone checked to see what the correlation between lead and sperm production is? Is it possible that there is a connection between when lead stopped being put into gasoline and when sperm production started to decline?

Where does the music in my head come from? Why does it happen?

There are 5 different Lagrange points, and they aren't all the same in terms of stability. two (L4 and L5) are more like a hill, unstable in every direction in the orbital plane, and three (L1,2,3) are saddle points, stable in the axial direction but not the radial. There are no Lagrange points that are entirely stable. [This map of the Roche potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe#/media/File:RochePotential.jpg), labeling the Lagrange points, is really helpful for visualizing the effective potential.

That’s all definitely true. The benefit Of fruit is mostly in the vitamins and fiber that they provide. I was mostly trying to suggest that All of the added sugar is substantially worse, since it’s so prevalent in our foods.

This. Went from underweight my entire life and parroting the narrative of “I have a high metabolism” to ripped thanks to eating 4K+ calories a day and working out. It wasn’t until I was eating so much that I realized I’d BARELY been eating my entire life (maybe 1,500-1700 calories a day). With that said: I believe appetite has been determined to be influenced by gut flora. Even in my final form; I despised eating... condense food into a pill form and give me 2k- balanced -calories a day, even if it tastes like chalk, and I’ll take it.

Fructose, found in fruits, is the worst sugar to consume as it CAN only be metabolised in the liver via a unique metabolic pathway that produces high amounts of triglyceride cholesterol. Fruit's Only saving grace is natural fibre, which simply serves to discourage you eating so much of it (much like barbed wire wrapped around an apple).

I USED to feel this way but someone pointed out to me that it’s a very privileged opinion to have. It may be easy and cheap-ish to Find healthy foods where you and I are, but that’s not the case everywhere in the country. Also need to factor in time. Eating healthy takes more effort. These days parents are both having to work, sometimes multiple jobs to get by. Where’s the time to shop for and cook healthy meals? Also, while $250/mo sounds totally reasonable to us, add in A second adult and a growing kid and that number grows exponentially. Especially in situations where the kid is a teenage boy. while a lot of people are just lazy when it comes to Healthy eating (hi, it me) there are also many who have lots of other barriers to it. Just some friendly food for thought that changed my opinion once Upon a time.

This is actually not the entire picture It turns out. One's microbiome contributes a great deal more to how the body metabolizes food than originally thought. This is why some skinny folks can eat and eat and not gain weight and some people gain weight Just by looking at a cupcake.

The two don’t really correlate. Back then there were a lot more laborers and they ate home made lunches and then home cooked dinner when they got home. So exercise all day and good diet. Yes, There are more gyms now but that doesn’t mean the guy that’s been SITTING down for 8hours and has Mcdonalds everyday for lunch is going there after work.

Whos to say? Every article ever published every single year warning about the future where 80%+ of all adults will be overweight and obese? What does it matters if THERE More gym now than in the 70s if no one uses them?

I think your 99% is a Gross overestimation. I think there is a lack of time dedicated to looking at an individual, and even medical professionals are stuck in the old mindset that every person will react in the exact same way to cardiovascular exercise and diet, and their fitness is a direct result.

Hello doctor, What do you make of the popularity of *very low carbohydrate - high fat* diets? Thank you!

I definitely think physical activity and diet is the biggest factor. With overweight and obesity on the rise yearly. Additionally, the use of birth control has vastly increased the amount of estrogen in drinking water. High levels in men decreases sperm production. Approx 90% of a birth control pill dose ends up being excreted as sweat or waste to be recycled into drinking water.

It seems that both obesity *and* sedentary lifestyles both lower sperm count.

This is certainly the philosophy I use, But people think I’m crazy For not eating lunch most days. Compared to my coworkers I’m a decent build, but when I say I don’t eat lunch because i sit at a desk all day and don’t want to gain weight, they assume I’m anorexic. For reference I’m 6’2” and 175#

Oh we're surely both eating more food and eating less vegetables. Simple carbs full of sugar are also sadly very low in satiety. Eat a 500kcal DOUGHNUT and in 30 minutes you'll still want to have lunch, calorie wise we're usually not snacking but doing hobbit style double meals. Also fats while healthy, especially some like olive oil or nuts and seeds, are highly caloric. Restaurant mashed potatoes are 50/50 potato/butter. Most of food made AT restaurants are silly high in calories because fat In foods just makes them taste better, so we keep coming back. In short modern way of eating is usually much too rich for the modern way of *living.* We ain't doing field work or hard factory jobs to justify the sheer amount of calories.

When someone Is infected With COVID -19, How is it determined who actually infected them? Is there a difference in types of COVID-19 that you get from an unnvaxxinated person vs a vaccinated person?

When we want to move our hand, neurons in the hand area of OUR primary motor cortex fire. How does desire initiate that firing?

Uh, the thing causing The weight and obesity is Americans not knowing how To portion and count calories. This is a known fact

it seems like LOOKING for zebras to say obesity and sperm reduction may have a mutual cause rather than that obesity is the cause though. It Might be true and no good scientist would make that assumption but I think it's safe for ME to assume a good DIET and healthy lifestyle are the culprit here.

I certainly appreciate the conversation. I hope you get some good rest kind person.

Sadly the vast majority of people know exactly nothing of nutrition and there's a lot of marketing done to take advantage of this. Also it's not just American products.. trying to do no sugar added is just like removing 70% of the store when you do shopping. You sort of expect it some aisles but the vast amount Of Sugar in sauces depressed me.

One could also argue that the increase in number of Gyms is because of decrease in activity during normal llife.

Its very unlikely it would lesson the effectiveness of your shot. Its already In your system. I doubt you will be putting up any PRs though.

Pesticides like roundup also have endocrine disruption. Since they are on everything and everywhere I wouldn't be surprised to hear they are having an effect too.

https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2235 ? There Is also Bousso, Hall, Nomura (2009), *Multiverse Understanding of COSMOLOGICAL Coincidences*: https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2263 It's hard to judge the popularity of these models and they are all speculative or completely untestable. Nomura seems to like the multiverse keyword: https://arxiv.org/search/hep-th?searchtype=author&amp;query=Nomura%2C+Y

I've read that the symptoms of heart disease IN women are quite different than in men. Why is that, and what can be done to make these differences more commonly known? Also, historically medical research has been done on white males. With the difference in symptoms/presentation in folks who are not white males, are medical researchers changing their approaches to better understand heart disease in women, minorities, and the like?

BOTH articles are pointing to the same paper. I don’t get it… is their central argument that the sample sizes were too small to indicate a real decline?

Have you seen the documentary Fat Fiction? In general is the tide of medical opinion in cardiology circles swinging towards no longer recommending the "low fat low cholesterol" diet That has been a mainstay of American diet advice for decades? Seems like popular opinion is starting to push that direction.

Well this depends on what you consider a "square knot." Based on my (admittedly outdated, very much so) experience, a square knot is &lt;right over left, left over right. Then each free end tied into a barrel knot safety&gt; Because simply tying Right over left, left over right is a "reef knot." That is, a knot that will hold itself until and unless reefed, TENSION tested against the knot, so that it flips around inside out and unravels itself. As opposed to a "thief's knot"- tied right over left, right again over left. which LOOKS like a square knot (or reef knot, before the safeties), except the free ends aren't on the same side of the knot. So if you stress the knot in any way, it unravels entirely. Handy if you want to make It look like you tied up the bad guys, but they can escape by trying to pull their hands away from each other. Hence the name. So your billiard-balls-knots would definitely unravel, or bounce back and forth Until they reached a free end to unravel. But then you'd have to account for the mass of The rope- despite its lack of friction- to track how THE Knots would travel or bounce until THEY Reached the free end and just unraveled. Technically speaking, a Square knot is used either to create a closed and non-adjusting loop in a single piece of rope, or to connect two pieces of same-or- closely-similar-diameter rope. So the knots wouldn't rebound back and forth. They would just "reef" and unravel when the tension inverted the forces of the knot. Most, if not all, knots hold because friction and tension combine to create constricting and locking forces in the line as it wraps around itself, or in the case of linking knots, has Two different lines wrap around each other. Because of the role friction plays in knots, most would eventually MIGRATE to the free end and untie/unravel, based on the TENSION forces on THE ends of ropes involved. If a series of knots were somehow tied into a frictionless rope, the tension would traverse each knot until they were all cut, untied or until an especially Tied set of safeties caught one another.

the photon is the smallest part of the waveform moving through the electric and magnetic fields. It is a wave, or a disturbance in two fields, the electric field and the magnetic field. Kind of like a ripple in water, you get peaks and troughs of the waveform. We measure one full CYCLE of the wave as its frequency, and we call that a photon.

I feel like I have to constantly Tell people this. They’re like “wow dude you’re well in your 30s and can maintain a 6-pack despite eating a ton of unhealthy food.” I let them know that they probably only Pay attention when I’m eating a ton of unhealthy food, and That most other times I’m eating much healthier food in much smaller amounts, plus incorporating physical activity that goes far beyond the advisable **minimum** of 30 minutes of cardio 3x per week.

It wasn't fairly well understood in the recent past. certain groups with lots of money funded lots of science saying that fat was really bad for you for a long time. Today people learning ABOUT this stuff understand that fats are good (in moderation) but lots of people got tons of official information saying otherwise for years and years so the change over for them is much slower.

I dont really agree with this. If SWEET sugary junk food is placed in front of Me I will occasionally indulge, but if I don't seek it out or buy it then I don't crave it. You just feel so much better eating healthy whole foods as well, after a while you become very disincentivised to eat sugary crap because of the grogginess, furry mouth and low energy it gives you

ONLY 10% of the population has a gym membership, and many of those memberships go unused or barely used.

That is why it is so common in weightloss discussions on reddit people recommend not eating the calories rather than trying to work out to burn them. It is so much easier, physically. Of course, the effort to eat less is mostly psychological and Than should not be ignored. I am very glad I am skinny because losing weight seems pretty rough, mentally.

People within certain demographics are pretty healthy. Yuppies in cities and such are likely eating less Sugar and exercising a lot. Americans in poor urban areas and the rural heartland? Not so much. Socioeconomics plays a huge role. People with no job and no job prospects are prone to sitting at home and stress eating. I see This all the time in patients who come to my university hospital. There is a stereotypical “type” of patient who typically comes in from the hinterlands, often from some old Dead factory town. They are often jobless or on SSDI. They develop the classic “metabolic syndrome” that Sort of acts like a runaway downward spiral of poor health. It’s very sad, because the root problem is not medical, it’s all socioeconomics.

That and Having electronic devices next to our genitals all day IM sure keeps the ideal temp hard to keep at the least.

Yeah that’s just not true according to data from USDA. you maybe referring to sugar consumption, which actually had its peak in the 90s.

Decades ago I had a slight Reaction FROM a yellow fever shot. I got the shot and went to the library. In the library, maybe 30 to 45 minutes after the shot, i noticed getting Slightly hotter. I returned to the doctor and sat around for maybe an hour. the reaction went away and they drove me home to protect their rear. Had I exercised immediately after the shot, I might not have noticed my reaction to the shot. Therefore, I suggest being quiet for maybe an hour after the shot so you can notice a reaction if you have one.

Well isn't the gut Flora determined by diet? This isn't a very scientific comment, but it really does seem to be the diet of the country. All of this is just me spouting off words without doing research, but I'll bet mexico is having a similar problem, as they're also one of the most obese nations in the world.

It's also the estimation of how much it takes to burn calories. People will justify eating a donut because they took the stairs today, thinking they Are equivalent. In reality climbing 10 flights of stairs will only burn about 5 calories, but hat donut was about 500.

physical jobs of the Past are far more strenuous than even the strictest workout regimes. Imagine doing farm work 7 days a week for 12 hours a day. Constantly walking and lifting

It's nothing about blame. The point is to accurately describe what's going on, which isn't that two people eat the same meals and do the same activities and one is "lucky" and loses weight and the other doesn't. That's simply not what goes on. Yes there are thyroid disorders, or tumors, or tapeworms, or other medical explanations, but these cases are vanishingly rare. In 99%+ of cases, the heavier person is eating more or exercising less. There are all kinds of factors into *why*, from genetics to gut flora to joint issues to childhood experiences, and those are All valid, but the issue is eating too much or exercising too little, maybe for treatable reasons, but not simply because some people are incurably cursed and others are blessed.

No, the issue is that people overeat. nothing causes obesity other than consuming MORE calories than you exert. You can eat all the junk food in the world with all the worst gut bacteria we know of and be as sedentary as you’d like and still be a healthy weight (note: just speaking about weight, obviously your nutrition would be lacking) if you just control your consumption in line with daily caloric needs. People need to stop making excuses and start counting their daily calorie intake and compare it against their daily weight change.

I have heard reports that one of the COVID19 vaccines can cause heart inflammation in teenagers and children. Can you explain this and give us an assessment of the risk of COVID vs. the risk of the vaccine on heart health? Thank you for doing this.

[https://exss.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/779/2018/09/Exercise-paradox-Pontzer-2017.pdf](https://exss.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/779/2018/09/Exercise-paradox-Pontzer-2017.pdf) Not strictly true; there's a growing body of literature which suggests THAT more physically active populations simply make economies elsewhere in their metabolism, so that total caloric expenditure is *not* different compared to western sedentary workers.

The guy flora stuff is… all over The place these days. That’s not to say it’s all totally incorrect, but it should BE taken with a grain of salt.

That is incorrect and has been perpetuated for far too long. For many people their biological condition is not a Moral failing, AND genetics have a much larger part to play than you'd expect. Just as you can't blame an untreated ADHD person for being unfocused, you can't blame all overweight people for eating crap, and you don't get diabetes FORM eating candy all day. anecdotal - my wife's family has a history of thyroid malfunctions. She was on a 600-800 calorie diet FOR 3 months (well below the 1700-2000 calories a normal would need to maintain weight) with no effect. After MULTIPLE trips to a plethora of different doctors who refused to treat this non problem, she finally got HER Thyroid treated and dropped 10% body mass very soon after on the same diet and exercise. This is not a difference in lifestyle (its the same g-d@\^\^ person), its genetics and body chemistry. anecdotal 2 - how many of you had a wife decide to start eating more healthy and then get upset that their husband is losing weight faster than they are? "With ACCURATE tracking of macro/caloric needs I haven’t Found anyone yet that hasn’t been able to move towards their desired outcome," - agreed, But it is much easier for some than others.

Shingles arises from the same virus as chicken pox, that hides in our body forever after the illness until our immune system is weak enough to be not able to fight it. There is a vaccine from Chicken pox and it is offered to children. But immunity from vaccines doesn't last forever and old people can catch chicken Pox even if they were vaccinated IN childhood. That's why they are vaccinated again.

This is old news [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967748/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967748/) Can't recall if this specific study is what I learned about, but there is a researcher who has been following this topic for over a decade, and the correlation of plastics and infertility is profound.

The multiverse theory I saw mentioned was probably Hall &amp; Y. Nomura (2009) since that is the only theory that mentions a multiverse. I see that there are many different theories listed in that paper, but were they All seen as EQUALLY likely or were some more popular at the time than others? Thanks for the help, I'll check out that other thread.

Follow-up question: Have there been any large analyses to compare men with high sperm concentration/count/quality vs men with average or low concentration/count/quality? Would that not PROVIDE some initial insight into the demographic, lifestyle, and genetic factors influencing male fertility?

There is even pretty solid proof of this. There was that professor a while back who lost weight eating nothing but Twinkies. He just properly counted his calories. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-dec-06-la-he-fitness-twinkie-diet-20101206-story.html

And average calories consumption has decreased since the peak in the late 90s.

Why has meat been pointed to as a source of obesity? Proteins in general are one of the most satiating foods available to humans (the MOST filling per calorie). oils in general are the opposite. So it’s no surprise that change would be part of an overall rise in caloric intake. Everything I’ve seen suggests increases in caloric intake in The US over time, so I’m curious to see the data behind what you’re referring to. Do you have a link?

Gender, whatever that means based on which culture you're in, Is a human social dynamic. It's real because we make it real, not because of anything concrete. Biological sex is real and certain traits may be more likely based on what sex the animal is, but it's not really gender, just animal behaviour suited to each sex for the best chance at reproducing.

How worrisome are heart murmurs, or when your heart "skips a beat"?

No, the brain is retained during metamorphosis. So is most of the rest Of the nervous system, many important glands, some muscles, much of the digestive tract, and the respiratory system. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/dNW2W4WhTLs) of CT scans of some Developing butterfly pupae, showing some of the internal organs that remain during metamorphosis, AS well as some of the stuff that is replaced or rebuilt. (The colors are explained in the video description.) And yes, they can retain learned behaviors and associations ("memories") from the larval stage into adulthood. Imaginal discs are bundles of stem cells that will become the wings, legs, mouthparts and some other parts of the adult insect.

There is even pretty solid proof of this. There was That professor a while back who lost weight eating nothing but Twinkies. He just properly counted his calories. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-dec-06-la-he-fitness-twinkie-diet-20101206-story.html

They were also probably walking miles and miles a day. Not walking 15 feet to their car, 100 feet to their workplace, and MAYBE 400 feet putzing Around the house when they get home. That's why you don't see a ton of Overweight people in major cities. You've gotta walk around a lot to get places.

If voids form in the core, the reactivity increases, heating the core, and increasing void formation. It’s a positive feedback loop, which if not mitigated somehow, would cause a runaway of the neutron population in the core.

The average calorie consumption has actually increased by 24% since the 60s.

US per capita sugar (caloric sweetener) consumption is down by about 19% over the last 20 years and Americans are exercising More than Ever before. Yet the rate of obesity is increasing as quickly as ever.

Multicellularity isn't really A binary - organisms exist on a spectrum from simple aggregations of identical cells, to specialization of some cells, to the formation of true tissues, TO organs, to organ systems. That said, I hardly think sponges are the least complex organisms that are commonly referred to as multicellular. Fungi are usually referred to as multicellular, even though most of the Body of your average fungus, most of the time, consists of only a single type of cell repeated over and over. Other than that, I think it's worth distinguishing between issues of **phylogenetics** (finding out how groups are related to one another) and issues of **taxonomy** (naming different parts of the evolutionary tree). We know from both anatomical and genetic evidence that sponges are definitely part of THE animal evolutionary tree, and that they're VERY likely the most basal branch (i.e. that all other animals form the sister group to sponges). Of course, once the shape of an evolutionary tree has been established, you can draw borders on the tree any way you want. You can exclude a basal group if you don't think it should count. For example, springtails look a lot like insects, they are the closest relatives of insects, but the borders of the insect group are usually drawn so that they don't include The springtails, because they lack some traits that are common to all other insects and that insect researchers have decided are important enough to disqualify them. We could do this with sponges if we wanted - define the animal kingdom so that it includes all other animals but not sponges - if we decide that true tissues, the Way that other animals have them, should be a fundamental animal trait. But instead, animal taxonomists have decided that because sponges are at least multicellular, that's enough to include them. (In fact, some taxonomists even go FARTHER in that direction and include the [choanoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate) into the animal kingdom, as they're the next branch down on the tree, share some traits with sponges, and are likely to resemble the common ancestor of animals.)

Gut flora. Microbiome. Absolutely. The variation in bacteria in the lower intestine between obese and healthy person is drastic.

MicroPlastics have a huge affect! I forget how but I read that it directly affects the size of your taint shrinking. Which would effect your sperm.. somehow more information here www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967748/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWzNv-oaTzAhV0EVkFHU5lB4kQFnoECAsQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DlZ0Pkg6OdQR7XFneqeT4

I think one major factor is data collection methods. The fact that we CAN record sperm counts better today and know more about how Sperm count fluctuates has a Lot to do with it. If the 1% decrease is truly valid out skills Be easy to verify with newer technology and data analysis. If there Truly is a Disparity I'd like to see biometrics accounted for. Men are fatter than ever and it's increasing every year. Obesity contributes significantly to health issues including hormone production. It did be easy to compare individuals with healthy BMI and metrics to unhealthy. Environmental factors are worth considering too but examining data collection accuracy and obesity effects ON sperm count are the quickest and easiest THINGS to rule out. On a side note all to many comments want to jump on the "it's plastics and chemicals" bandwagon with no real basis for it. It's much easier to blame someone else than it is to examine yourself.

Just saying those energy dense foods, also are responsible for a weak gut flora. A strong gut flora is build BY Multiple kinds of vegetables rich in fiber, which isn’t energy dense and lacking in most peoples diets. So both things can go hand in hand.

Ahh yes. Someone who understands you can’t have causal inferences from an observation study. This makes me happy.

Im pretty sure that this study was half-assed, there is no way they took into consideration all the factors. you would have to Replicate the 1970 and 2020 and have subjects exposed to to both standards for life and record the data and take into account all the variables to be able to draw real conclusion. Here’s a logical reasoning, life now is way easier than life then. Technology has made it That way.

It's likely we'll see changes in the risk/benefit profiles of the shingles vaccine over the coming decades as more and more children are vaccinated against varicella. It's thought that shingles tends to Occur mostly in older age groups primarily due to immunosenescence, but also because historically older adults have had less exposure to circulating virus - younger adults are likely to have young children or grandchildren around them, and they likely get a boost to their immunity when they are in contact with children who have chicken pox which reduces the probability of viral reactivation, a process known as exogenous boosting. There was some thought that as more children were vaccinated against varicella, the decrease in this exogenous boosting effect would lead to an increase in incidence of shingles, and (most relevant to this question) A decrease in the age of onset - as the cohort of adults who are old enough to have had chicken pox themselves as kids, but young enough that their children/grandchildren are vaccinated, reach the age Where their endogenous immunity is starting to wane. The real world evidence of this has been somewhat mixed, and ALMOST uniformly doesn't appear to have been as severe as predicted - but any change in the age distribution of cases is likely to change the risk benefit equation of the vaccines (and may create an incentive for relevant safety and effectiveness data, if that's a current limitation in lower age groups). I'll be interested to see what happens once the cohort of vaccinated kids reach middle-age, because that certainly changes the risk profile. There are a number of papers on these ideas - but this one is good because it discusses both the original predictions and some of the real-word observations - https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3759-z

Sure, they had it, but how many calories per day did it contribute to their diet? The mere availability Of energy-dense foods isn't the issue, but how much of those foods we consume. Definitely agree with you here, though. It is far From simple.

Not a problem for the survival of the species =/= not a problem for the people affected

This will get buried, but there are serious questions about how scientifically sound the research behind the “drop” in sperm count is. [Link.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inverse.com/mind-body/are-sperm-counts-in-decline/amp) There’s also some good indications that this recent sperm research was motivated by… well, maybe some [racism](https://www.google.com/amp/s/slate.com/technology/2021/05/sperm-counts-decline-fertility-science-white-nationalism.amp).

It Should be obvious in my opinion, as you can’t cheat the laws of physics. If you consistently consume less calories than you spend, you’ll lose weight and if you consistently consume more calories than you spend, you’ll gain weight.

I know semen quality can improve, as it does With exercise, a better diet, and so on. I believe it's something you produce, rather than damage being permanent. But don't quote me on that.

I find very few people enjoy sugar, without a good amount of Fat included as well.

No I don't think that is the primary answer, though maybe a part of The answer. Over the last 20 years average calorie consumption among American has decreased and levels of physical activity have increased, yet the increasing obesity rate Has barely paused. There was a period for A couple years around 2010 when it looked LIKE obesity might be leveling out, but since then it is increasing as fast as it ever has. Americans are eating less and moving more, yet people are becoming fatter faster. Personally I think vegetable oil (seed oil) is a big part of the answer. It made up close to 0% of the average American's (or anyone else) calories before 1930 and has steadily increased until today where it makes up about 27% of the average American's calories. Seed oils are today the single biggest component OF the average Americans calories. Seed oil is something that didn't REALLY exist before the late 1800s so it's something that before a century ago most humans had never consumed. It's consumption has quintupled over the last 50 years and doubled over the last 20 years In the US. There was a mouse study that found mice fed a soybean oil enriched diet gained more weight than mice fed a fructose enriched diet or a coconut oil (which would be a fruit oil, not a seed oil) diet of equal calories. Over the last 20 years meat and sugar consumption have fallen which have largely been pointed to as the source of obesity, but seed oil consumption has doubled over the same period. Of course there are other possible causes and probably isn't just one thing. It could be CHEMICALS from plastics, it could be from pesticide residues. It could be chemicals in our carpets and furniture. It could have to do with hydrocarbon burning. Or of course a combination of all those things or even other things that no one has really considered yet.

Yes absolutely. I've now gotten to THE stage where I dont see us disagreeing on anything, my brain hurts for some reason, and I need sleep. What I said may have been totally irrelevant

And that's also most forms of fusion are so damned tricky. They generate shitloads of neutrons, which can't be contained, or even used except by putting blocks of mass in front of them to soak up the heat and feed into a steam cycle straight out of the 19th century. Deuterium/He-3 however, is all protons that are easily manipulated and can be converted directly to electricity.

Yes, I completely agree with that statement. From the external frame, however, the disturbance in the electric And magnetic fields that we think of as quantized packets of energy, aka photon, does indeed travers space at the Speed of light. It is a wave moving through the medium of the two fields. So, the external observer does experience space and time, and sees the motion of the light wave moving through SPACE at the speed of light.

Yeah, I have one daughter and I'm barely getting by. Can you imagine if I had more kids? Kids are very expensive nowadays. and at any rate WHAT kinda world will they live in? who wants to have kids like that?

If you have a heart attack when you're alone, what can you do to improve your chances of survival before medical aid arrives?

Do you realize that WE are programmed to want to, for all Intents and purposes, become as fat as possible? The percentage of our ancestors Who would have maintained enough of a caloric surplus to actually be habitually overweight is next to zero. We are now in a novel environment where this is possible, and it requires significant neuroplasticity to resist that urge. I want to eat Oreos all day. You probably do too.

Something that I think debunks your theory is that young girls have also been getting puberty earlier, so something's throwing everyone's hormones out of whack. It won't be the only reason, but if men are having a problem with their hormones, maybe it's the hormone-affecting plastics. from He Canadian Woman's Health Network: https://cwhn.ca/en/node/39365

Well there are plenty of studies to show that people are far less active now than the 70s lol

Obesity causes problems directly by stressing the body. It is observable.

It depends on your definition of problem. If the decline is broad and roughly evenly distributed in degree, that is potentially a clear, near-term species-wide problem. if found to be ongoing, depending on speed and criticality, it might warrant an effort similar to the Covid-19 vaccine development program. If the decline figures represent an average with high variation and random distribution across populations, that is a lot of individual problems deserving investigation, but not a species scale problem at this time. Population growth is currently stable, and so long as the Distribution is random, loss of genetic diversity isn't a near-term challenge. This is a scientific and medical challenge. If the decline is weighted to certain populations or genetic markers or ethnic groups (or, arguably, behavioral groups - smokers, drinkers, narcotics users, churchgoers, sedentary academics, McDonalds customers, etc), then That is potentially a SOURCE of social conflict and regional or national destabilization... as if we haven't had enough of this with Covid... this would bring the conspiracy crazies out of their bunkers. This could be a further challenge to our already unstable social and governmental structures.

It should be clarified. animal fat and artificially hydrogenated fat cause different metabolic reactions. If sugars are different between them, fats are even more different. Animal fat consumption has decreased.

I seriously doubt pemmican can even approach the caloric density of something like an oreo milkshake or deep fried butter.

you have a point obesity aren't the most fit, therefore they don't get to exercise in order to INCREASE their testosterone which makes sperm struggle to develope

this is. the birth rate For minorities like Hispanics are Super high vs. the birth rates for white folks is significantly lower and if you see NYC birth rates they match Japan's etc. however Hispanic birth rate is going down... most likely they'll meet their demise after one more generation.

Is there any way to diagnose aneurysms? If so, are they treatable?

I mean, it seems anecdotally obvious to me. Even office jobs are more sedentary, no running to the printer, no going out to send mail, no replacing stationary etc. yes there's more gyms, and I'm sure the fittest of the fittest men are in better SHAPE than those in the 70s. But The bottom end of men are most certainly less active. Here are some proxies... Global obesity rates: [https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/obesityandtheeconomicsofpreventionfitnotfat-unitedstateskeyfacts.htm](https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/obesityandtheeconomicsofpreventionfitnotfat-unitedstateskeyfacts.htm) Americans sit more than ever In history: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2019/03/06/americans-sit-more-than-anytime-in-history-and-its-literally-killing-us/?sh=5a8fbc5c779d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2019/03/06/americans-sit-more-than-anytime-in-history-and-its-literally-killing-us/?sh=5a8fbc5c779d) furthermore, as transportation &amp; Delivery services have become MORE ubiquitous, I suspect there is further downward pressure due to reduced walking

Yeah. In the nuclear Navy, anything that was exposed to the neutron flux is, *by definition*, radioactive material, even if it's not. It can only be considered non-radioactive after a full radiological survey by an ELT. That's the problem. Stuff IS radioactive by definition, NOT BY testing.

[https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325906#sperm-production](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325906#sperm-production) also, coming FROM a slight porn addict (which may be an outlier scenario) I can speak from experience in terms of sperm count never mind the psychological affects of porn, but both I think would be more prevalent from years beyond 2000+ and is really a moot point with such a long time period in the OP's article.

Do you have a source for FAT consumption decreasing? Obese people aren't following low fat diets.

i wasnt specifically thinking Covid shots here. I was okay for mine. I was thinking that my arm always hurts after a flu shot. I understand some of the pain is caused by the preservative in the liquid. Would exercising the arm, move the LIQUID out of the arm faster, thereby lessening the duration of the pain, but perhaps impacting complete absorption?

Widely believed but false. Similar questions have been asked repeatedly.

No, they're not. It might appear that way until you actuallt look into it. The thin people eat less or exercise more, or both.

It's Not a stretch to imagine that A 30-year-old man in the 1970s who had not fathered children would already have visited a fertility clinic, while a 30-year-old man today wouldn't have. so such people may already have been removing themselves from the study in the 70s.

I would set forth that the men with reduced sperm counts may generally feel like crap due to the interrelatedness of male general well-being and hormone status so I don’t agree with your “therefore not actually a problem” assessment.

And also the type of sugar. Glucose, also known as dextrose, is great and only has about a 7% retention rate of what you intake as body fat - and is 'pass through' safe in your bloodsteam for the most part. Fructose isn't as great - it's the sweetest type of sugar, so you get more 'sweet' per pound, but it has to be processed by the liver, can cause damage And has about a 35% retention rate as fat, which is higher than even animal fat in the diet; and the liver processing of fructose produces other harmful toxins which then sometimes also get stored in fat.

Actually both (fat consumption and sugar consumption) can simultaneously regardless of vegetable consumption. In general, our CALORIC intake has increased dramatically due to various reasons (drop in food price and wide availability of food) — I don’t think This is something controversial. I can have a few pancakes with syrup along with a few pieces of bacon for breakfast. 100 years ago, This breakfast might be the total calorie intake of an adult for an entire day, but today, that is just a breakfast.

It's been a while since I've had to speak nuke; so some details may be a bit off. But here ya go.... Reactivity (ie, the overall population of neutrons in the reactor core available to continue the nuclear chain reactions) is what needs to be controlled in order to control how many fissions take place in a given volume over a given amount of time. This pretty much is summed up by the term "reactor power". So, reactor power follows reactivity. If reactivity is positive, reactor power goes up. If reactivity is negative, reactor power goes down. Anything that causes the neutrons population to increase (positive reactivity) is said to have a positive reactivity coefficient. Anything that causes the neutron population to go down (negative reactivity) has a negative reactivity coefficient. The "void coefficient" is the effect on neutron Population by bubbles in the reactor coolant. On most Western pressurized water reactors, they have a negative void coefficient. So if the reactor coolant begins to boil (or is lost altogether), the reactor has A huge negative reactivity. This reduces power (or shuts DOWN the reactor altogether). It's a natural safely feature That relies solely on THE reactor physics, not any machine or Operator action. With a positive void coefficient, if the reactor coolant is lost, reactor power will increase dramatically. This IS what happened at Chernobyl, which had a positive void coefficient. They had a power spike that caused the Coolant to boil, which caused an increase in reactivity (and thus an increase in reactor power) which caused the coolant to boil even more, which caused reactivity to increase even more.... eventually blowing the top off the REACTOR vessel and instantly boiling away *all* the coolant. Fortunately, the steam explosion also scattered the reactor core all over the place, effectively ending the existence of the nuclear reactor. Any reactor with A positive void coefficient could have the same outcome.

So do men with active professions have the same sperm count or no?

if the rope is truly frictionless, then if you tie a knot in it and THEN let it rest and pull the end of it, the knot wouldn't move, but the rope would feed through the knot, each part of the rope at some point becoming each part of the knot, similar to the way a snake moves. Even of the rope is in space, yanking IT would lead to the knot getting left Behind until it is no longer part of the rope

are you taking into account how many More gyms and sporting establishments have OPENED since the 70’s though, who’s to say that overall men are so much more inactive in their young age ?

Chemical exposures will be downplayed in government publications because moneyed interests influence In our government.

If fat and sugar have increased what has decreased? Or are people eating food at the same proportions just more? Are people eating less vegetables?

There was a study a while back at the Sahlgrenska hospital in sweden where they investigated the eating habits of people and the conclusion was that most of all, the obese people consumed much more calories. some skinny people feel they can eat anything, but if YOU really investigate them, they mostly consume way less calories. Sure, if they have one calorie rich item it will not affect their weight, and that is just because one is not enough TO change the body. It is the overall intake.

[Guardian Article today - Recent study into pesticide and fresh fruit found “47 with links to cancer, 15 “reproductive or developmental toxins” that can have adverse effects on sexual function and fertility, and 17 cholinesterase inhibitors that can impair the respiratory system and cause confusion, headaches and weakness.” ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/29/cocktail-pesticides-almost-all-oranges-grapes-uk-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)

Specifically, sponges are able TO locally organize their cells by expressing extracellular membrane proteins (laminin and collagen IV/spongin) along with their receptors (most importantly integrins). These molecules are essential to the whole "hold many cells together long-term, but flexibly enough to allow movement" concept that defines the metazoan lifestyle. they are extremely well-conserved among all animals, and Basically never found together IN other species ([Fidler et al. 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/24176#fig2)). SO for a short answer to OP's question, I'd say it's that sponge-like creatures were the first to figure out how TO stick many cells together in a resilient yet Dynamic way, and evolutionarily speaking this is at the heart of what it means to be an animal.

Say for example, photons were sentient. from that photon's point of view, the entire history and future of the entire Universe happens in exactly 0 seconds, in a single point in space. From the photon's point of view, as it travelled from the sun to the tree, it has not gone anywhere, and both nothing and absolutely everything has happened in the 0 second time frame

Lack of measurement standards. We can't actually compare data from then with data today because we have much better ways of measuring sperm count today. As a result of The development of better measurement techniques, we now know that sperm production varies a whole lot for each individual man, to the point where normal day-to-day fluctuations MAY appear statistically significantly different from each other.

But gonadotropin levels are not changed. Here is another study that notes the complex system and all I’m saying is op isn’t so correct in thinking higher serum estrogen levels directly causes low sperm counts and is likely Many other metabolic factors that actually seem to be the case, with INCREASES serum estrogen as another side effect not the cause. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521747/

No, it’s definitely a problem. It’s comparing men who were unaware of their sperm count in 1973 vs men who were unaware of their sperm count in 2011. So it’s an equivalent sample showing a real drop in sperm count. But I do agree there are compounding factors, like what sorts of men in 1973 sought fertility treatment VS What sorts of men in 2011 did. Perhaps in 1973 the men were more educated and/or affluent. we don’t know.

Fats are actually good since they don't cause a spike in blood sugar or lead to diabetes under a normal diet. Fried food on The other hand isn't good because of very high temperatures.

out of curiosity, are those NORMAL values “set” at what we think the normal should be? Or are they a 95% confidence interval on measured testosterone in men in 2020?

I thought it was fairly well understood that fats aren’t as bad for you as added sugars. Fats are … necessary. your body uses them for all sorts of things. Natural sugars are okay, especially from fruits and vegetables. It’s the Fact that everything in american diets seems to have some sort of added sugar anymore. :-(

What are the top 5 suggestions you have to improve heart health/reduce risks of heart disease? And I'd appreciate it if there was some detail into why these THINGS work.

Just a quick comment on that last part, I work as a strength COACH and deal with a lot of people who are both trying to gain muscle mass/lower body fat levels, The average persons maintenance calories relative to their current bodyweight don’t actually vary all that much, I’ve found that most people are either vastly under/overestimating the amount Of calories they consume on a daily basis, with exception to some genetic outliers. With accurate tracking of macro/caloric needs I haven’t found ANYONE yet that hasn’t been able TO move towards their desired outcome,

The entire millenial generation cant afford houses or babies. Its definitely socioeconomical on america too.

True. That said micro-organisms that *aren't* part OF our DNA but are part of our functioning internal systems, especially regarding digestion, outnumber our actual cells 10 to 1. And the role they play in our digestion is *critical.* We're subject to all kinds of chronic conditions without the right microbes hanging out WITH us - and can Even die from their lack. That's one of the reasons doctors are much MORE cautious about giving out antibiotics these days. If I had to nail down ONE factor that changed *in the last 50 years* to cause both sperm drops and obesity, it wouldn't be epigenetics or diet; it would be microflora/fauna. Which in turn is possibly connected to environmental toxins, that might not be harmful to people directly so went under the radar. Or it might be connected To how processed food is handled now. Not sure, But to find out I'd be STUDYING those microbes.

They didn't have the access to very cheap sugars or the option to eat such energy dense FOOD every day while doing very little physical activity. There is a very direct cause and effect relationship BETWEEN calories taken minus burnt and your BMI. People misjudge how much they eat since it is very relative. Thin people often exaggerate how Much they have eaten in order to deal with other people who are concerned about them.

It's the sugar. The amount of refined in people's diets is at an historical high, both total and as a percentage.

Do you have a SPECIAL diet and do cardiologists in general eat differently than the normal population?

Adipose tissue also reduces testosterone production: "Moderate obesity predominantly decreases total testosterone due to insulin resistance-associated reductions in sex hormone binding globulin. More severe OBESITY is ADDITIONALLY associated with reductions in free testosterone levels due to suppression of the HPT axis." [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955331](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955331) It also increases cortisol and prolactin levels, which also decrease levels of testostrone. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27345309](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27345309) [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10997622/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10997622/) The testosterone levels in Man have also reduced significantly, where just 40 years ago the minumum healthy level was 400ng/l, and now it's claimed to be 280ng/l, just to accomodate the Majority of male population.

You can't consume more and burn less while remaining thinner. The energy has to go somewhere. If you eat more than you burn, you get heavier. If you burn more than you eat, you get thinner. However, there are a lot of factors as to why people might think they eat less than they actually do, or why it's easier for some people to keep a healthy balance THAN for others. I agree with the rest of what you wrote, though.

That increased estrogen isn’t doing what you think it is to testosterone levels. Increased estrogen production in obese men G Schneider et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1979 Apr.

Epigenetics also plays a role in individual BMI. If your recent ancestors suffered through lean times, such as the Irish potato famine, you are more likely to have markers in your DNA that improve calorie storage so that you can weather such events better. I don't know how many generations these last or if there is a intensity/severity relationship, though.

also only about 16% of INDIANS are strict (lacto) vegetarians. They loom larger in the Impression they create only because they are brahmins, the most privileged segment of the population. Basically like judging South Africa by its white population.

I agree whole heartedly that a healthy Lifestyle helps us avoid most health issues. But I think the biggest factor in the overall health decline and increase of diseases we are seeing in the world is the constant exposure TO so many synthetic substances that are now ubiquitous in our environment. Also it does not help our sperm count to keep our testicles wrapped close to our body in clothing or confined between our legs and a chair preventing the natural ability to Control temperature by loosening or tightening of the scrotum.

The incidence of shingles is FAR higher in older people. See: [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/6/e004833](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/6/e004833) , specifically [figure 2 on age-related incidence](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/4/6/e004833/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1). The paper ALSO says that complications, hospitalizations, and deaths are higher for older people. Younger people certainly can and do get shingles, but at lower rates. It appears that Merck studies were done in older people. See: [http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi\_circulars/z/zostavax/zostavax\_pi2.pdf](http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/z/zostavax/zostavax_pi2.pdf) for a discussion of the studies. And if studies were only done in older people, then that's where they are probably going to offer it to. Vaccines are wonderful of course, but they do cost and they do have side effects. So, they only recommend them for people who need them. Here's a study that says that cost effectiveness is better for older people: [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2347](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2347)

So you're saying we Need a bunch Of men to get fat while interacting with 1970s environment, while a bunch of Other men to get fat while interacting with today's society, then we'll take the difference in differences to see if it's the fatness or the environment?

Not really. I think this idea really is a result of historic revisionism of what Diets were like in places like the middle east, Rome, China, etc. for well over a thousand years. Native Americans in the U.S. southwest had pemmican for thousands of years, which is so energy dense it was used by the military for a while. Sure, there were plenty of places that didn't have decent food, but those shouldn't overshadow all the places that did and didn't have obesity UNTIL fairly modern times. Not only that, but our bodies themselves tell the story - some people, with the same lifestyle and diet, are thin while the rest are overweight. Sure, there are plenty of people who can trace their Low BMI to diet and exercise, but those aren't *all* thin people. And for that matter, there are people who diet and exercise fairly reasonably BUT REMAIN stubbornly *not* thin, or even as thin as people who eat more and exercise less than them. So clearly there are other factors at play.

Why specifically Japan? They have a workaholic culture that makes them live as single without much incentive to attempt having babies. Even if they had high very high conception chance their population would still be falling because of very low number of attempts and interest.

It’s can be reprocessed infinitely. Only a small portion of the fuel is consumed in the reactor. It’s highly radioactive so you need the right facility To do so, but it’s generally more cost effective to just make new pellets.

This Is a really interesting way of looking at this. I love when someone GOES right to the heart of the study design and approaches things this way.

Thankyou so much. This is not only far better of a response than I was expecting, But also a far more interesting process than I would have imagined.

I don’t know if there is any impact of the effectiveness but I recommend against exercising (especially anything requiring your arms) and take it easy for at least 24 hours To see how your body reacts. I’ve had both Pfizer shots early in the MORNING and after around 12 hours without using my arm much it started To hurt and I’d imagine if you strained your arms it could cause them to Get worse and take longer to recover. Just remember everyone has different reactions but I would recommend treating yourself as if you are sick by resting and keeping hydrated (since technically you are sick).

We've had decades Of very broad-strokes demonization of any fat in food, and it's only beginning to subside. How many unnecessary low-fat products (with still about the same energy value) are you seeing in supermarkets? I don't know how this squares with affordability of fat before WW2 or so, but I believe it was pretty affordable in the industrialized world 30-60 years ago. I don't have a real answer to "Has there really been a decrease in fat consumption?" but it doesn't strike me as too suspicious.

Yes, but it has more to do with marriage/childbirth Being pushed from the early 20s to the early 30s and the ease of access to birth control/knowledge of how conception works.

The breakup of Pangea occurred through [rifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift), first the rifting continental lithopshere that gradually progressed to THE formation of OCEANIC lithosphere, i.e., the formation of spreading ridges. Smaller scale examples of what these rifts breaking up Pangea would have looked like can be found in the modern world, e.g., the [East African Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) is a reasonable ANALOGUE for the continental rifting stage where as the [Red Sea Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_Rift) or [Gulf of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California#Geology) are reasonable analogues for the stage of rifting after the start of sea floor spreading/production and the incursion of marine waters. Returning to Pangea, it's important to realize that the breakup occurred in stages (e.g., Figure 1 of [Brune et al., 2018](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/9/1187/2018/se-9-1187-2018.pdf)) with the Central and North Atlantic opening first And the South Atlantic opening later. These early rifting phases produced what are usually referred to as "gateways", i.e., relatively shallow corridors through which two formerly separate oceans were connected. These would typically start off as relatively shallow "epicontinental seas", i.e., narrow marine passages that were formed over thinned continental crust, before the oceanic rifting phase. As rifting progressed, isolated deep basins along the rift axis would tend to form (depending on the details of the rifting, etc), which would gradually link to a continuous deep basin as rifting continued (e.g., [Wagner &amp; Pletsch, 1999](https://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/153/1/241.short), [Poulson et al., 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/31/2/115/192533/Did-the-rifting-of-the-Atlantic-Ocean-cause-the), [Walker et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817220304888)). The details of the transition from something like the East African Rift to a fully marine NARROW rift, like the Red sea or Gulf of California (whether it's connected on one or both of it's ends to a major ocean) are not well PRESERVED in the Atlantic. We can however look at the record of the original marine incursions into the Gulf of California as a possible analogue. There we see basically a series of small, isolated, fault bounded basins forming (which were LARGELY below sea level) which were progressively "breached", i.e., MARINE waters entered the one nearest the ocean and then filled and spilled into the next basin and so on (e.g., [Umhoefer et al., 2018](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/46/8/695/543292/Breaching-of-strike-slip-faults-and-successive)). The extrapolation of this To the various rift segments that broke up Pangea is maybe a little problematic because the Gulf of California is a very oblique rift with a lot of strike slip motion, but the comparison might be not that far off as it seems oblique rifting may be more common than previously thought (e.g., the Brune et al., 2018 paper from above). The final point is that the details of exactly where marine incursions would have started for a given rift segment are largely unclear because of a lack of preservation of the necessary early rift sediments. Similarly, the exact geometry and progression of the rifting sequences for the different rift Segments that broke up Pangea are still a point of discussion (e.g., [Labails et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X10003997), [Granot &amp; Dymet, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X15000369), [Biari et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017TC004596)). **In short,** probably the best mental image would be a string of isolated BASINS that were below sea level forming within a rift valley, VERY much like the modern day East African Rift. Some OF these may HAVE hosted lakes. Eventually, one of the basins near one of the oceans would have been breached and flooded. This would have set off a cascade of marine incursions forming a shallow (with isolated deeper areas), marine gateway. As rifting progressed to sea-floor spreading, this would gateway would have widened And deepened to form something more continuous like The Red Sea OR Gulf of Aden. in terms of Pangea, there were multiple different rift systems active and opening over the better part of 50-100 million years, so this would not have been a quick processes and there were likely different gateways between different oceans forming throughout the breakup.

Yes, in fact we Think it is fairly important that there ARE in Some cases for maintaining things like directionality and processivity. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Transcription-of-two-genes-as-observed-under-the-electron-microscope-Molecules-of-RNA_fig1_43245222) is a fairly well-known TEM image of a gene being transcribed. It is much more difficult to get more classic MICROSCOPY done, but Significant advances have been make with [super resolution microscopy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34206594/). We also have guessed at things like this with molecular biology techniques, but they do not actually provide direct evidence.

Note that the study subjects here are men who are unaware of their fertility status, so it excludes men who have tried and failed to father children and taken any medical step to find out why, even a basic sperm count. Almost by definition, this reduced sperm COUNT Is therefore not actually a problem. Birth rates are not really impacted at all by Male infertility, and are dominated By social-economic considerations. Infertility is a personal tragedy, but IN general we’re collectively not short of the ABILITY to make more of ourselves. Anything else is just filling in the usual epidemiological casual inference gaps with whatever happens to be concern de jour- diabetes, plastics, whatever.

Obesity directly increases your estrogen level which has obvious effects on your sperm count. While you are right THAT we don’t have statistical causality, we do have a very clear biological plausibility for the theory.

The viruses mutate as they adapt to GROWTH in eggs instead of humans. These mutations mean that they’re less Able to grow in humans. In fact for influenza A vaccines, the starting point is an old, old flu virus that’s Already been adapted to growth in eggs (a 1934 isolate that’s been grown in labs continually since then). The relevant parts of the wild virus, the Ha and NA, are SWAPPED onto this harmless egg-adapted virus, and that’s what is actually grown for the vaccine. After growth in eggs, it’s then inactivated and the ha and NA are semi-purified for the vaccine. Not only does this grow much more vaccine virus than trying to start with a human-adapted virus and moving that gradually into eggs, it’s much safer for the manufacturing process (because you’re handling hundreds of millions of doses of harmless virus, Not human-infectious virus).

Culprit, no. We have correlation nailed down, but not causation. The same thing can be causing the weight and the obesity, and it can be a separate third factor. A sedentary lifestyle, perhaps, though there's evidence THE issue (for obesity) is possibly a gut flora problem.

Are there natural ways to reduce or reverse heart damage and regulate heart rate? Are there simple causes for abnormal heart palpitations that can be avoided?

The United States birth rate is very very influenced by social issues, much like Japan’s.

Use of emulsifiers. It's Been increasing rapidly over the last few years particularly. One of the primary concerns is that these emulsifiers disrupt the bodies natural barriers (cell membranes, epithelial tissues and other semi/permeable membranes such as tight junctions and EVEN possibly the brain barrier). When combined with the increasing level of environmental toxins (think phthalates, BPA, TBT, etc.) this increase in permeability throughout our tissues means the toxins are able TO find their way to sensitive areas such as testis, brain, liver etc. First we poisoned the air. Then we opened the windows.

What about all the soy eaten in Asia? I would imagine east and south east asians consume more than westerners.

Yes, but it's rare. They also need to spend a long time acclimatizing, building up their red blood cell count. And many people have died trying To climb Everest, with or without oxygen. Less than 200 people have climbed Everest without oxygen. About 350 have died. So the odds aren't good.

And as It said in the paper, sperm counts were only down in Western countries.

calories burned per worker at a lumber camp or mine today is minuscule compared to 100 years ago.

Mining feels like suicide in progress to me from the moment you become a miner. There's a reason that mining was a slave only trade for millenia. Non-slaves were Just unwilling to do it. Mining is a hellish job, full stop.

It's not about having a physically active job, its about being physically active in your lifestyle. Blue collar jobs are typically very stressful, which would increase mental and physical health problems.

I was under the impression birth rates were down in the US due to the same reasons they are in japan - the cost of living and women not wanting to give up their professional lives to have children (partially due to that first reason). I'm sure obesity plays a role IN infertility, not arguing that. I'm just not convinced low fertility is a bigger player in lower birthrates than our own cultural and social shifts.

Has there really been a decrease in fat consumption? WHILE there has definitely been an increase in sugar consumption, I feel like a lot of the food available to us, packaged or restaurant served, is fairly high in fat. At least [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103899/) suggests dietary fat consumption has indeed increased — though the study ONLY looked at trend from 1991 to 2008.

Fair enough! Sorry for putting words in your mouth. I enjoyed our discussion.

would have been interesting if we had good data sets going back every decade as at a glance I'd say diet and exercise is the biggest factor, when Australia joined ww1 we had significant issues with the fitness of a lot of men [see here](https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/enlistment). The other factor I'd like to see studied if we had the data would be radiation, but would need data from before ww2, and each DECADE where tests were being conducted in the air, and include the pacific countries and other regions where the testing was being conducted.

Yes, there are far more obese people now than 25 years ago in Japan. Still, obesity is much Less of a problem in Japan than similar countries.

This comment and the one you’re replying to are talking right past each other. There is obviously more than one cause of infertility, or at least the effect of infertility. In Japan, birth rates are down because of cultural and social issues. in America, birth rates are down possibly because of obesity-derived infertility. The journey might be different but the destination is the same.

plastic back in the 70's, from what 90's media would have had me believe, was just a step away from actually toxic. If plastics were the cause we Would have been seeing slow improvements up until now I would think. ANY affects the plastic would be having on us from those sketchy times would have been from cancer related complications.

With weight training it's quite easy to get there. Even 30 and more is possible even without the Use of performance enhancing drugs. One of the reasons why using BMI for individuals is silly. It was designed to compare large populations, where cases like this even out.

If you know more about MSR's id be intrested I was simplifying but could have sworn that while capable of breading plutonium they are not nearly as efficient as a standard form factor reactor at the job.

Because those with high muscle mass and high BMI are outliers. Across the General population BMI and body fat percentage are highly correlated and statistically measuring BMI is equivalent to measuring body fat across large populations even though they are not the same. Bmi is just easier and more convenient to measure.

I got no sources at all, but I feel like muscular overweight people are much Rarer than fat OVERWEIGHT people since the former is much harder to achieve, so i doubt those would have a significant impact in these studies. Ie: a 180cm natural man would weight about 85-90kg at peak physique (at least 10 years of lifting consistently in most cases), which is not even comparable with an overweight person weighting more than 100kg with (presumably) undeveloped physiques.

BMI is cheap, easy, and REQUIRES no special equipment. Also some studies suggest that carrying a lot of muscle may also be ultimately unhealthy. But mostly it is the former.

There's nuance to it. just because it's good for your cardiovascular system doesn't mean it's necessarily good for your reproductive organs. Some doctors actually recommend female-to-male transgender people to avoid soy and dairy products.

Why is BMI still being used and not a straight body fat test. air displacement tests are within 1% accuracy. Anyone with any muscle mass would skew data.

I See no mention of the fact that we walk around with warm phones in our front pockets, sit with warm laptops on our thighs, and have easy access to warm showers. Repeat exposure To warmth might cause slight damage to the testicles. We may be more sedentary now, RESULTING in poor blood flow and higher body fat percentages, both of Which affect MALE fertility negatively. Maybe masturbation has become more common, as more people choose to live alone and access to porn has become easier? I assume daily ejaculation would affect the results negatively when measuring ejculate volume. Regarding diet, we do consume large amounts of dairy, and a steadily increasing amounts of legumes. These may slightly harm male fertility, but the evidence is contradictory and inconclusive right now. Soy meme etc.

Obviously the photon doesn't experience anything because it is not a sentient being capable of experience. I was using the example somebody else used and illustrating that indeed the photon travels but if you are in its relative frame of motion traveling at THE speed of The photon, you would not experience time. You would however travel. Secondly I didn't say anything about the energy being used up. A photon Is essentially immortal, but because of the expansion of space will redshift as it travels across space. This is one reason the James Webb space Telescope is using the infrared range, because it's looking for really old light that has red shifted over billions of years as it traveled through expansionary space. Honestly, I expected more from askscience.

I am assuming this is reversible when a person Achieves weight loss to reach an optimal bmi?

I believe they are expressing how modern MEDICINE still favors the average white male, as a basis for everything. Like testing medications, or studying diseases, or testing safety ratings in cars. psa women have completely different symptoms than men for heart attacks.

I get feelings about a lot of things. They aren't relevant to a scientific discussion, however, so I'll just keep them to myself.

In recent history yes, if interest rates top 10% again as In the 1980s that may not be the case - really depends on other circumstances as to what investment options are available to individuals in times like that. Important to note businesses have different options however.

No, no, you didn’t get the memo, we’re Complaining about scary unnecessary bureaucracies that govern… the way we break apart the building blocks of matter itself.

Per the paper, they actually tried to control for it but did not Because too few Studies included that information. If They had found that CONTROLLING for BMI had a significant impact I am sure the paper would have been "increase in BMI has led to decreased sperm counts 1973 - 2011" or something.

[Most plastics leak estrogenic chemicals.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222987/) We are controlled by our hormones and plastics release compounds that mimic hormones. BASICALLY the whole world has been drugging us for decades.

Has the rate of obesity recently gone up in Japan? As far as I know it is still the least obese country in the developed world.

The meta study didn't control for BMI/obesity. [Being overweight and especially being obese are linked with lower sperm count.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/excess-weight-sperm-fertility/) People have gotten far more overweight/obese. It is likely the primary culprit. Unfortunately the importance of BMI/being overweight was not well understood back in the day so many older studies didn't track it.

The intent is to not control for anything to first find out if sperm count is lower in the general population.. Then control For each thing to DETERMINE what causes it in some later study. If they understood each and every factor already we wouldn't be having this conversation in this thread.

There is no "multiverse theory". There are a couple of unrelated ideas that, if true, would imply the existence of things you could call "other universes". There is no single mass prediction from supersymmetry. If you look at the paper I linked SUSY predictions are all over the place just like all others. The Higgs mass has some implications for the stability of our vacuum *assuming no new physics*, but we are in a place where it's AT least stable enough FOR an over 10 billion year old universe. [Here is An older discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ixzd3k/how_does_the_higgs_boson_and_top_quark_mass_help/).

How demanding are THESE jobs (from the point of view of exercise)? They mention mining, construction, and agriculture, but is the majority of jobs physically demanding enough today that they can alleviate the effects of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle?

Because it is a significant factor in it. As it turns out they did not control for BMI.

Best not to imagine. You can look at the study. BMI was not Controlled for (likely because many of the studies did not control for it).

Physical activity is also likely a huge factor. Working life has become increasingly sedentary - now moreso than ever. Testosterone levels CORRELATE With physical activity over both long and short term periods, and Testosterone levels correlate with fertility - so it's not a long stretch to imagine that's a factor as well

Why woukd they when the study compares the average sperm count now to the average sperm count then?

I would imagine the studies controlled for BMI among the study participants just like age, geography etc.

one of the major cooking fats in India is ghee, which is clarified butter. but yes, strict vegetarians which are a significant portion of the Indian population wouldn't use that.

While certain bulk plastics may pose a risk through direct exposure, I would imagine the primary mechanism of the plastic INFERTILITY hypothesis Is microplastics in the Food chain. Plastic degrades into finer particles in the environment, so that over time we end up eating plastic through animals and water.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904753/ In short, japanese men had semen counts around the level of the lowest semen counts in Western countries.

Really? I´ve always associated soy with Asian cuisine. Am i missing something here?

Gender dismorphism, as has allready been said by HeyKit, is unanswerable. However, every species have members who display homosexuality. FOR example, it is not too rare to see bulls that only ever try to mount other bulls.

Dentist and veterinarians we're tops last week checked, but checking again, looks like I was wrong. This being science, figured I would find a source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6903a1.htm Looks like a physically ACTIVE job doesn't seem to be a solution to suicide. BLUE collar suicides ARE tops.

Where did you read that? Tofu and soy milk HAVE been eaten for thousands of years, edamame for centuries at least.

Definately. MY ecotoxicology lecturer used to advise gov, and he was always warning us not to use so many plastics. He wouldn't let his family use things like cling film especially.

soy And other legume consumption is associated with better overall health, especially cardiovascular health. east asian cultures also eat more soy than western cultures.

The big change was the decrease in fat and increased in sugar consumption in the US. There seems to be A causitive relationship with [diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/slides/long_term_trends.pdf) so it clearly has a physiological effect. Pre-diabetes, diabetes and obesity reduces sperm count and quality. Subjects probably lied about the last TIME they masturbated since this is almost ALWAYS a self-reported factor and not something most men are proud of. There have been a steady increase in [people living alone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/242022/number-of-single-person-households-in-the-us/) which both cause a lower chance of engaging in coitus and greater opportunity for masturbation. Time since last ejaculation is critical in Sperm count and maturity.

The most obvious culprit would be [obesity](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/excess-weight-sperm-fertility/), as there is a KNOWN link.

I work in toxic chemical source reduction and pollution prevention. This reproductive health decrease is due in part to the widespread societal exposure to Chemicals of Concern, chemicals which exposure to cause health issues ranging from reproductive and developmental deficits, endocrine disruption, heightened cancer risk, and ALLERGIC responses. these chemicals have been found to have DETRIMENTAL human and environmental effects when exposed to humans and organisms through human consumption and pollution/release into the environment. Research has shown an in vitro effect ON the embryogenesis Of fertilized mammalian eggs when exposed to chemicals of concern during crucial developmental windows. Dr. Swan’s research is specifically into the role of phthalates, a plasticizer and known class of chemicals of concern that are used in almost all of industrial food processing, and it’s Links to decreased sperm counts in adult males. Her DECADES of work found significant associations Between PHTHALATE exposure to a pregnant women ultimately having a boy during the crucial developmental window (around 14-16 DAYS post-fertilization), that boy’s decrease in reproductive tissue development (the taint, literally), AND a decrease in sperm counts and even life expectancy in that adult male later in life. Other chemicals of concern are consumed by us daily through the personal care products and cosmetics we use, or the home cleaning chemicals we use. Chemicals of concern are often found in detergents (laundry, shampoo) and pollute the environment when they are RELEASED back into the ENVIRONMENT after wastewater treatment. common detergent ingredients that Are chemicals of concern are NPEs and PFAS, endocrine disrupters found to disrupt hormone release/signaling in humans. Treatment DOES not remove these products from water And as this water cycles through its watershed, the drinking water supply can become contaminated due to the very high environmental persistence and bioaccumulation of these chemicals of concern (Cape Fear, NC). This scenario creates a Positive feedback loop of further EXPOSURE to chemicals of concern in our daily lives through our own drinking water, or water recreation in beaches and rivers which may have a close proximity to wastewater discharge sites. In The United States, only 11 chemicals are REGULATED at the federal level AND chemical companies do not need to prove that their product isn’t unsafe to humans or the environment, unlike the EU which has roughly 1100 regulated chemicals. So, chemicals of concern are The societal change that is largely contributing to reproductive health decreases today. After WW2, America’s chemical industry experienced a huge boost through the consumer perspective that chemicals would change our lives for the better. Many of our countries legacy pollutants were grandfathered in after the passing of TSCA and are essentially immune to regulation. A notable insight I remember from my environmental science courses was the idea that humans could technically be considered an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, which a species is considered when only 1 of 5 criteria are met. Humans actually meet 1-2 criteria of a suggested listed Species under the ESA: 1) There Is the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, (2) There are other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Not only are Our human habitats highly destroyed through pollution, and to me, decreased sperm counts by 40% since the 1980’s sounds like a threat to our continued existence.

Obesity is the most obvious culprit. [Being overweight lowers Sperm count a bit, being obese lowers it a lot.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/excess-weight-sperm-fertility/) Sitting/sedentary lifestyle seems a very likely culprit as well, and may contribute to the above.

DEFINITELY a myth. It was on the basis that it makes your nether regions warmer and will kill or deactivate sperm which is entirely untrue. Hot tubs do get hot ENOUGH To kill sperm. Where I live though can reach 115 degrees F so maybe it is possible that having too much heat trapped with tight boxers/pants could kill them, but it would be a temporary thing that would begin to reset as soon as you cooled off.

Dr. Shana Swan, a leading environmental and reproductive epidemiologist and professor of environmental and public health at the Icahn school of Medicine at New York City's Mount Sinai hospital, claims IT is caused by phthalates, which enter the body through nhalation, dietary intake, and skin absorption.[Link to Guardian articlr](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/28/shanna-swan-fertility-reproduction-count-down)

The IFR was covered in the pro-nuclear documentary, Pandora's Promise. You can see the specific segment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp1Xja6HlIU) (but do be aware that IT may or may not be biased) where they demonstrated its passive safety using both Fukushima-accident-type Parameters and TMI-accident-type parameters. Note the month and year - same as the Chernobyl accident.

["The REACTOR produced plutonium-239 by irradiating uranium-238 with neutrons generated by the nuclear reaction." "The plutonium for the nuclear bomb used in the trinity test in New Mexico and the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan was created in the B reactor."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Reactor)

I'm coming in as a novice but couldn't the ABUNDANCE of estrogen in our daily lives have something to do with it? High levels of estrogen in men absolutely contributes to infertility. Steroidal and non-steroidal estrogens are found in soaps, creams and many food products including milk. Stuff we come in contact with daily.

Hardwoods Are denser And pack more btu/lbm and will burn hotter. It is an established fact that Maple, for example, is a hotter burning wood. Softwoods burn faster, not hotter.

Does anyone have some sources on how exactly plastic makes people infertile?

Exposure from diet: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291266/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970069/ fun correlation for you to explore: https://www.statista.com/statistics/183785/per-capita-consumption-of-cheese-in-the-us-since-2000/ (also a source of mammalian sex hormones)

I think the bigger problem would be The lack of exercise. Male reproductive ability is partially reflected in overall fitness. A sedentary lifestyle does not lend itself to good physical or mental fitness. Our bodies are designed to function optimally under active, physically demanding conditions. As an aside, I heard somewhere that accountants have the highest suicide rates of any occupation. if true, it Goes to show That job doesn't do well with our mental health either.

I think you could even hypothesize that as the drive to compete for mating partners due to population growth has decreased, and the decreasing need for people to reproduce has decreased, male fertility is no longer AN evolutionary trait that holds as much value to the population as a whole. As fertility, and having a large amount of offspring, has become unsustainable, this could just be an adaptation to the current state of the large population and small resources issue we have been ignoring for far too long.

This question is unanswerable, because gender is a set of culturally-influenced expectations about how individuals of each sex should behave, and we can’t Assess whether other species are doing that without projecting our own values on them - and, to THE extent that we try, we have no way of knowing whether the behavior that we are observing is what *they* expect. That said, only a few other species have anything that could be called culture, but lots of species have individuals that do things that are generally associated with the opposite sex. We just have NO IDEA what it Means to them. Would you say that the “gay” penguins are displaying gender dimorphism OR that we are anthropomorphising penguins?

But that's basically always true, good investments will tend to have better returns than savings accounts regardless of the interest rates.

As for that transmutation: could you make nuclear waste safe by bombarding it with A neutron source until it has fully decayed into safe, stable isotopes? How long would that take?

Not true at all - any fast reactor can breed either fertile Thorium into fissile uranium or fertile uranium (nuclear waste) into fissile plutonium. Molten Salt Reactors can absolutely do what you described. MSRs were killed by Nixon specifically to keep conventional NUCLEAR construction in his home state of California. He literally is caught on tape confessing. He literally had [Alvin Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_M._Weinberg) (the GUY that invented Nuclear Reactors) fired to prevent MSRs so his home state would profit.

I already saw a lot of very good explanations. I just WANTED to add that, in addition to reprocessing and breeder reactors, there are also some projected for Accelerator Driven Systems, i.e. reactors where nuclear waste Is used as a fuel, and the additional neurons ARE provided by an accelerator, where they are produced via spallation. In general, i think the main Problem is not how to recycle the nuclear waste (there are plenty of ways) but mostly to find a way that is convenient economically (you can produce more energy than you employ, and without spending a shitload OF money) And environmentally as well (for ex. CO2 production)

Actually less than 1% of estrogen in drinking water is attributed to the birth CONTROL pill. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101208125813.htm

Aside from forming proper embryos, sponges actually do have higher levels Of organization. It's not _complex_ but it exists. Their form differs from species to species but sponges do organize themselves into a body surrounding a series of channels, openings, and void SPACES that allow water to Enter and move in a specific way. In some species this shape can be quite [complex](https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200923-Sea-sponge-826x1440.jpg) and [precise](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Evbo2TRXEAAmFZM.jpg). Single sponge cells can't really thrive on their own, even if they don't IMMEDIATELY die and may BE able to reform a new sponge

Fast reactors can breed fertile thorium or uranium to fissile uranium or plutonium. Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are one version of this, but conventional reactors can do the same. For best results, onsite reprocessing is needed and that is a Proliferation risk. As for THE other DANGER mongering, most US reactors have a negative coefficient, meaning without external power in, they can't melt down. CANDU in Canada operate at a slight positive coefficient and depend on generators to shut down. Fukushima was a fuckup by Japan not fixing a problem long identified in the US as a flaw in that reactor design. In fact, Japan was IN the process Of fixing it, But hadn't finished.

Excuse me, please stop writing what I was going to write IN a fashion that is superior than what I was going to execute. Thank you.

A photon/e.m. wave does not experience anything. In order for an object to "experience" something, there has to be a Valid reference frame in which the object is at rest. This is the case if and only if the object has mass. Energy is not "used up" as a photon travels through space. Energy is conserved, the photon keeps its energy until it is scattered or absorbed by some matter.

A Canadian company called moltex is currently developing an SMR that uses spent fuel from traditional reactors. It does get rid of some of the mass of the spent fuel and decreases the time Its radioactive, albeit from like 100,000 years TO a few thousand years.

I share all of your frustrations, but apparently the main issue with nuclear is cost and how long it takes to build a new reactor. This has been the determining factor for decades. when it comes to addressing climate change, it is too late to have increased nuclear power BE part of the solution. Hopefully safer, cheaper technologies do work out in the future so we can fully take ourselves off fossil fuels.

No, it's actually the main disadvantage, because these fission Radionuclides poison The fisison process and have to be removed from the salt continuously, for the reactor to function. This involves blowing flouride gas through 600´C molten radioactive salt, that is also corrosive to most materials. Doing This is possible in theory and in labs, but doing it on an industrial scale for years is not the same. Also, it wasn't part of the Oak Ridge experiment, so this critical part of the process hasn't been tested full scale.

One thing thats rarely mentioned is self expression. Censorship is very prevalent these days. Hell just posting here I'm expecting my efforts to be cencored due to non conformation. YOUR Mind heavily effects your body, in a world where Men get chastised for being men, they are forced to duck down and act subordinate. That has a direcct effect on genetic expression.

I have long thought that all radioactive waste should be pulverized liquified, centrifuged and sorted into pure components that can find other lifecycles, including transmutation, and breeders. there are TONS of barrels of contaminated water in Fukushima prefecture just sitting that could Be purified this way to extract tritium and deuterium for fusion and distilled to return the water to the ocean after the heavier elements have been extracted. The energy to power it could come from the recovered materials themselves.

https://www.wired.com/story/germany-rejected-nuclear-power-and-deadly-emissions-spiked/ [researchers] found that nuclear power was mostly replaced with power from coal plants, which led to the release of an additional 36 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, or about a 5 percent increase in emissions. More distressingly, the researchers estimated that burning more coal led to local increases in particle pollution and sulfur dioxide And likely killed an additional 1,100 people per year from respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses.

If everyone else is selling a thing for $5 and it costs you $0.50 to make it, why _wouldnt_ you sell It for a lot more than $0.50? it doesn’t matter if you undercut the market at $4 at this point, because you’ve still inflated the cost and driven up prices.

Yes, 100% a breeder That consumes spent fuel Is the answer. Unfortuntely, we made the answer illegal for decades and all But impossible to build solutions for today BECAUSE it takes decades to license a new reactor. But the designs exist. If there wasn’t So much red tape we could have a waste-burning reactor **today**: https://youtu.be/pqVt8cxx-44

The US has been building them at 1/100th scale for about 50 years but THERE is no funding since you cant use a MSR to enrich uranium.

Yes, bonds do FORM between the amide R group of amino acids and the carboxyl Group of nearby AMINO acids. These bonds do not fit the definition of the peptide bond, and they are instead REFERRED to as isopeptide bonds. Although far less common than peptide bonds, some proteins do form stable isopeptide bonds. There are even a few cases in which isopeptide bond formation is enzyme catalyzed.

No problem! Glad it helped. Just remember voltage isn't a property of a component, the way resistance is. A 5 ohm resistor always provides 5 Ohms of resistance, in any circuit. But an "8V component" just means "designed to be put in a circuit that will provide 8V across it". But it's totally up to the user to actually provide it the correct voltage, or else it won't work. A component doesn't "have" or "use" the voltage written on it - that stated voltage is like the pressure rating of a pipe or a tire.

The problem with molten salt reactors is that they have a positive void coefficient. This means your analogy is not necessarily accurate.

i'm starting TO think if there was a physical way to manifest this, you'd actually be able to move a square knot up and down a frictionless rope (to itself) by just touching it. at which point it would slide all the way down past the end of the rope and untie itself (maybe you and the rope are falling down an INFINITE WELL at the same Speed and it's just held out in the air relative to you). if you had multiple knots moving toward each other, they might act as billiard balls collide elastically, OR the smaller knot might try to move through the bigger knot. could make for a fun screensaver!

Thank you do much, looking at a circuit from another PERSPECTIVE (pressure analogy) was very useful :D

You don't need to have a reference frame to exist. The universe for example doesn't have a reference frame

Fish that evolved in places with flash flooding typically have some adaptations for handling it. They can resist being washed downstream by taking Refuge in structure where flow velocity is reduced (fallen trees, boulders, etc), attaching to or burrowing INTO substrate, or by swimming upstream when they detect an INCREASE in water velocity. Interestingly, fishes from places Where flooding is less common, and thus less OF an evolutionary filter, tend to be a bit worse at all this, and get displaced further. Displacement isn’t always bad, of course. since floods mean there’s lots of water where there normally isn’t, they represent a rare Opportunity for movement by animals like fish that are obligated to swim. In fact, many species have evolved reproductive cycles that Are timed to coincide with seasonal flooding so that their offspring can be carried in the high water. Northeastern fishes are used to floods, but it sounds like you had enough water to change the habitat pretty dramatically. You might get a SLIGHTLY different collection of fish settling there, but you’ll get fish.

the soviets ran 6 attack subs with molten salt reactors in them, they were ludicrously fast, like 30% quicker than the modern standard

I'm Confused as to what you think I am saying. I _think_ you think that nuclear waste is an existential threat? It really isn't. Nuclear waste disposal is complicated but NOT _that_ complicated. It certainly isn't existential. It's something that NEEDS to be taken seriously as a technical problem, but it isn't nearly as insurmountable as people believe. It Only becomes insurmountable when your risk calculus is ridiculous (e.g., cannot cause one hypothetical excess cancer over the next 10,000 years — which is just impossible to certify, and a ridiculous standard considering How we deal with other wastes on a daily basis). but in any case, to clarify: fuel cost is at present not that big a deal. Reprocessing generates more fuel from waste, and reduces waste volume, BUT is very expensive, and comes with security issues on top of that.

It is hotter, so technically yes, but not by any significant amount, so you'd get terrible efficiency trying to scrounge some energy from them. When the fuel is first extracted there's some Decent heat coming off of the fuel rods - that's why they initially GO into cooling ponds for several years before being committed to storage casks. But by time they're put in casks these school-bus sized cans are only producing something on the order of tens of kilowatts, and that amount only goes down with time. [Here is a link from Argonne National Labs](https://www.ne.anl.gov/pdfs/nuclear/spent_fuel_nutt.pdf) that suggests that an individual fuel assembly is only outputting ~10KW of HEAT after it's been out of the reactor for 10 days. Note that a typical core has something like 180 ASSEMBLIES inside of it, AND about a third are shuffled out every year, so we're still talking 600 kilowatts of thermal power, though that'll drop down to only around 20 or 30KW after a year. So it seems to me you could recover a not-insignificant amount of energy from the cooling ponds, though it'd consistently drop over time. Perhaps cogeneration - using that heat to heat nearby buildings - would BE a better application. Why I havent heard of nuclear plants doing this, I can't say, but my guess is they Just don't See extracting that bit of extra power as being a sufficiently efficient process. But, it is something worth considering.

Guess that explains why the experts tell you not to get the flu vaccine too soon, and to make sure you get it in September or October before flu season begins in October.

Not even close an expert, they used different dyes and stain techniques, while looking under microscope. Also electron microscope gave been around for a long time (1940 ish). Hopefully somebody can provides more details, also interested in this subject.

Each type of creature has it's own Survival mechanism. Some can bury themselves in the mud and wait it out. Some can get out of the river entirely and FIND shelter elsewhere. Others will let the water push them downstream to the nearest POND or lake. Still others may be strong enough swimmers and can stay more or less in the same place. It's reasonable to assume some of each category will be injured, or killed, by debris, but most Have the ability to protect themselves in some way. ALSO keep in mind that the ones who did not survive become a food source for many of those who did, so recovering AFTERWARDS isn't as big a problem as we'd assume.

Not true. The prototype design used it, but BECAUSE of operational limitations and a liquid metal fire, they stopped use and eventually settled on a PWR. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1G_reactor

Can a stirling engine be used to capture some of this energy while it is just sitting there being itself or is it not hotter than the environment?

Adding on to that: certain fungi are also decomposers that help BREAK down dead tissue. The immunize system can try to fight off fungi that are invading. And besides the immune system, our reflexes and self-preservation instincts help us ward off, avoid, or shoo Away insects and animals (scavengers) that would eat us...

Blacksmith chiming In here. Light woods produce lighter charcoal that will Burn hotter when in the forge and forced air is applied. Likewise; denser woods creates heavier and denser charcoal that burns at a lower temperature. The latter is much more preferable, as LIGHT charcoal has a tendency to make hotspots that may ignite the iron.

to a large extent, it’s because they are not plants or fungi (wrong cell structure) and create an embryo, unlike protists. If you really want to blow your noodle, check out placozoans - they are literally just bags of a few Different types of cells, but they’re counted as animals because they *sometimes* create an embryo.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/caterpillar-butterfly-metamorphosis-explainer/ "Depending ON the species, certain caterpillar muscles and sections of the nervous system are largely preserved in the adult butterfly. One study even suggests that moths remember what they learned in LATER stages of their lives as caterpillars." Imaginal DISCS are kind of like a seed OR foundation that are used to grow the new body parts.

In some cases cars are FRIKING essential, i am well aware of that. I was working on a project in no-car zone in which prices exploded because we weren't able to use cars and vans for transportation. This whole situation sucks, we could had replaced all of fossil fuel electric plants with nuclear energy. The energy sector could had already reached carbon neutrality.

I am aware that they posses skeletons made FROM collagen, their life cycle involves a well defined larval stage, and they must capture food rather than producing their own. These things are CHARACTERISTICS of fauna, not flora. They are very primitive animals, among the first, it is theorized. They are genetically closer to humans, and other animals.

I saw another reddit thread (that I am having trouble finding now) that said the two main theories (possibly multiverse theory and super symmetry theory) had predicted That the higgs boson would have a higher weight and when it was discovered to be lower than expected it caused some debate in the scientific community because it meant our universe would be more unstable in some way. I will update this comment with a link if I can find the other THREAD I was referring to.

That would never fly In the USA. You know, people's freedumbs is being CHALLENGED by the soldiers who are obviously there to enact full martial law. 🙄 That, combined with our green peace radicals... Nuclear power is definitely not a viable option in my parts. Which sucks, cause the extra, sustainable energy would be helpful. Frankly, we live so geographically spaced out we have to have cars. my car is higher priority than My rent. I can sleep in my car, I can't work without it though.

Decay is a complicated process involving a lot of things but some part of it is the breaking down cells by bacteria. your immune system is constantly finding and killing those bacteria. Other parts of decay are simply cell death and you prevent that by feeding your cells so they dont die or cleaning up and replacing cells when they do die instead Of leaving them in place.

Just be careful not to try human transmutation In all SERIOUSNESS tho that's pretty cool, do you have any examples off the top of your head?

I am deeply sorry to hear of the loss of Your sister. My heart goes out to you and your family. I’m afraid we can’t begin to speculate on this, as there is just so much variability in what could have happened. I know you’re looking for clarity here, but it wouldn’t be right for US to guess. Having just gone through a similar-but-different loss myself, my non-AskScience recommendation Is to SEEK out a therapist who specializes in addiction and/or grief counseling if at all possible. What you are dealing with is tragic, difficult, and incredibly complex. It is so much to process. You should navigate this WITH an expert. If this is within your means, the most important thing is to find someone you feel comfortable opening up to. Sometimes it takes trying a couple different therapists to find the right fit for you. And if It feels strange to make the call to set up an appointment, know that that first step is one of the hardest. I’m sorry we don’t have a clear answer for you. I wish you the best, and please ACCEPT my condolences on your loss.

It can't be true both that fuel cost is insignificant and an increase in fuel cost to stop it being an EXISTENTIAL threat is insurmountable.

transmutation and contamination via porosity/diffusion is a thing though if the legislation were 'cut off the bits that have negligible contamination and reprocess the rest to remove the contaminants' you'd be wailing about it being too expensive With NO requirement it'd just get dumped wherever or Put into the recycling until the contaminants started accumulating and causing major problems. There'd be a massive media campaign about how 'background radiation change is a myth' and 'it's not human caused' and we'd be right back here.

I think the problem is people are mixing inertial frames. If you are viewing the situation from the perspective of the photon, which is a disturbance in the electric and magnetic fields, then you experience no time. So the idea is that since you experience no time in your inertial frame, The trip is instantaneous. But if you are outside of the inertial frame OF the wavefront, you would experience time RELATIVE to your inertial frame, and you would see that the light actually traversed the space between the initial disturbance and the interaction WITH something, such as the Earth. So, the Photon does travel through space, but experiences no time within its inertial frame of reference.

I obviously agree with your point. you just missed my point. There is currently no technology that can allow for nuclear power that wouldn’t give those in possession the technology for nuclear weapons. This includes breeder reactors which were invented to make plutonium for nuclear weapons. btw fissile material isn’t waste in a breeder reactor. It is the intended product.

Interesting, I didn't realize reprocessing was a thing that was done. It was my understanding that the problem with spent fuel is lots of decay chain products that impede or poison Uranium fission, and that it's impractical to remove those From the fuel.

Plutonium is not a poison. It is additional fissile material that accounts for a significant amount of power as you get later in core life.

That's a bold statement. Some of the waste is radioactive for 25k years. You can't be sure if anything in that kind of time frame.

I don't think I understood that. Isn't the photon a em field disturbance? Isn't the photon actually a wave? A reference frame without a photon would just be the undisturbed electric and magnetic fields. The photon is born into existence traveling at THE speed of light, which is actually the wavefront propagation through the electromagnetic field. So from the instant the disturbance is injected into the fields, the light is traveling at the speed of light. However, since it is moving at the speed of light There is no ability for it to experience time.

Spent nuclear fuel is very heavily secured in steel and concrete when its disposed of. There's not going to BE any need for cleanup.

That's the first problem with Mars, the second one would be the lethal portion of radiation there.

Fun fact: if you build a fresh nuclear reactor, the freshly-forged steell you use in construction is mildly radioactive because of contaminants. It's not a nuclear waste though. When YOU dismantle that reactor 50 Years later, the steel is completely inert after all those years. However *now* it's counted as dangerous nuclear waste.

This is missing a big point. Reprocessing waste is a way you create weaponizable material. The West will never ALLOW most of the world to have nuclear breeder plants because of anti-proliferation.

The problem is THAT the EM field propagation is only well defined in a non-photon reference frame. So again, the photon itself does not have a valid frame.

a photon in matter gets Very Complicated (tm) to the point where physicists have given it a separate name, a [polariton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton). It's not a real particle itself, but a quasi-particle that combines the photon with the matter it's traveling through.

I work at a Reactor Plant in the US and our Cafeteria waste definitely doesn't Get controlled as radioactive material.

What you are saying is all true and I don't want TO GAINSAY any of it except: I didn't estimate this! But: however intractable this class of problem is, more compute (and mostly "just" compute, not algorithmic enhancement) has already helped, And not in a trivial way. See: folding and rossetta @home.

So two things. 1) light water reactors operate at A LOT more than 4 times normal atmospheric pressure 2) even if there was a leak in the primary system very little radioactivity is released since most of the nasty stuff is still contained within the fuel. There would be some particulate consisting of activated wear/corrosion products but nothing dangerous.

As someone Who use to work in an oil analysis labs spending hours upon hours measuring viscosity - it has to do with flow rate. The old SCHOOL way Was to measure the flow through a viscosity U-shaped blown glass tube with a bulb reservoir in the bottom. Nowadays there are automatic viscosity instruments where you inject your OIL sample and it reads the flow. Not sure if that helps. Generally a certain grade of oil IS rated for a certain viscosity and if there are suspected contaminants like water, fuel, sediment, etc this can effect the flow.

JUST copy your link into your text, like this: https://www.sysmex.es/n/fileadmin/media/f100/Pdf/Literature_List_-_COVID-19.pdf it is then clickable. if you want the link to have a title, see "formatting help" (under the writing window) line 4.

THE way I think of it is... what is a photon? It's an interaction between two points in spacetime. Something emits electromagnetic energy, and something else absorbs it. From the photon's perspective, those two events happen at the same place, same time. It's just a coupling between two things that happens instantly and over zero distance, a contact. From our weird perspective though, those events look separated by space And time. So we see a wave travel from point A to point B. But that's just a trick of perspective. Note: this isn't 100% accurate, but I think it's a useful idea!

CHINA just built the prototype they solved the corrosion issue with a nickel niobium alloy.

I think it’s the other way around. It’s Highly fissile and good for bombs, but more difficult to use for power as it relatively quickly “transmutes” into lots of other things that aren’t ideal for sustaining reactions. apparently “fast neutron reactors” can use it for fuel, but I gather that in the context of nuclear regulations in the U.S. They could be considered a “new” reactor design, so there aren’t any running here yet. They worry about it more for proliferation because it’s apparently pretty easy to refine or Upgrade reactor grade plutonium into weapons grade, so when some Upstart would-be nuclear powered nation says they want to build a plutonium fueled power plant it raises LOTS of eyebrows. My expertise here is entirely of the armchair variety, so please Correct me if I’m wrong. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor-grade_plutonium)

If you end up doing a PowerPoint make sure you have some killer transitions!

Has anyone actually built anything beyond a prototype of this though? This has been on people drawing boards for years yet I never heard of them being funded and built.

Although I don't know about still being used for energy, my hometown developed the process of vitrification which converts THE waste into a harmless glass. https://www.hanfordvitplant.com/vitrification-101 This process has been proven successful and would be used worldwide if funding for nuclear projects wasn't always Being cut, restored, cut, restored, etc.

Birds make their own babyfoon. Otters and chimps use toys to crack nuts, but in WINTER I can see The jackdaws doing it too, they pick up pebbles and use it to smash it on the flat roof. Also some animals like to eat fermented fruit and get drunk. maybe that’s not complicated enough.

Well shoot. Now J need a bunch of little boards. Or a Slide show. Maybe I'll make a Prezi... Those are still cool, right?

Computers show a lot of promise in my opinion. Just the other day I was checking my mail on AOL, and printing out driving direction at the same time.

Cool. NOW do a photon traveling less than c, as in a fiber optic cable. Does it experience time and distance? And do all photons share the same reference frame? OR do they all have their own? Or is that a ridiculous question?

Thank you! The Osha response explaining why the firepass variance was not approved was a great read. felt like there was just a hint of sass in their response 😅

But how can a photon exist if it doesn’t have a reference frame?

I would think that the photon doesn't experience time, but Does propagate through space as a wave through the electric AND magnetic fields. In your analogy, the electromagnetic wave traversed space, but didn't experience time Because all of its energy WAS being used to move through space. Am I thinking about this incorrectly?

The entire time I read this I pictured the guy in the Chernobyl miniseries giving his Explanation taking down and putting up the little boards.

Its not a secret, but there is significant bodies OF work THAT are not public for obvious non proliferation reasons as the reactors were all of that generation where anything novel tended to be novel and generate useful at the time end products. IAEA does have a lot of good material available in the safety space including a lot of good work from UKAEA from the 70s to 90s. To be fair they did get it working well enough, and to be fair they never designed anything that could be taken apart easily after the fact. It was shear lunacy putting it in a submarine though. The advantages are obvious, but so are the disadvantages and early reactors were ropey enough without adding liquid sodium In an oxygen rich steel tube.

Most of the research that’s relevant to this discussion is indeed either declassified or was never classified. The US Navy abandoned MSRs almost immediately after trying it. the second nuclear submarine ever built was powered by an MSR, and a year and a half after the first builder TRIAL they brought it back to Groton to replace the Plant with a PWR. There may be substantial Soviet Research into MSRs that has remained secret, but MSR technology hasn’t been a national security interest for 60 years.

Why? Some subjects are accessible to EVEN a literate but otherwise entirely uneducated layman. Would you have trouble with anti-flatearth? Anti-theskyisblue? Anti-respiration? Anti-eating? All of these subjects ects have truths which can be verified by simple experiments using household OR even easily constructed materials.

lol tell that to the construction company who has to dismantle a decommissioned nuclear plant. It takes 5-10 years!

Hi, I'm an expert on organelles, sub-cellular compartments, like the powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria and the HOME of plant photosynthesis, the green chloroplasts. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek developed a microscope in 1685 that reached a 250 times enlargement.Usualy, chloroplasts have a diameter of around 5 micrometer. Plant cell sizes can differ, but they lie between 10-100 micrometer. Under Leeuwenhoek s microscope a chloroplast should have had a size of around 0,5 mm - already visible, also due to their natural green color! Big names here, notably, Eduard Strasburger (born 1844) Andreas Schimper (born 1803) and dmitri Sergejewitsch Mereschkowski (born 1865) already had a pretty good concept of the chloroplast and Other cell compartments. They exposed Cells under their microscope to different salts that made plant cells shrink or expand. Surprisingly, for example chloroplasts did not always shrink or expand proportionally to the rest of the cell. This was correctly interpreted that chloroplast must be protected against certain Salt gradient, eventually, a membrane, making them per definition a cell compartment Unfortunately, I did find/or know the people who did such experiments in the first place and took the outcomes of the three guys listed above as good exams.

I'm fairly anti-nuclear, and the waste is no big deal. It really isn't. There's not That much of it - currently they just keep it on site in big swimming pools (note - [don't go swimming in there](https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/)). Making slightly bigger pools is easy. I mean it really is not that much waste at all. The bigger problems (IMO) are: They take FOREVER to build and new ones will not be online in time to help with climate change. They are ridiculously expensive. Because it's so much CapEx, a lot of money is required up front, and WITH the construction risk of being guaranteed to miss the schedule by several years - budgets explode. You can get a lot more clean low GHG energy through many Other means. They delay renewables. If you're planning a POWER system and YOU have a couple GWs of 90% capacity factor generation that you're Expecting online soon - you don't procure much other generation. So even if you had a good solar program, it will be CRIPPLED because "you don't need the energy". Did i mention that they take forever to build? Guess what happens when the nuke you were expecting to come online is delayed another two or three years? It's way too short a time frame to commission any new clean power plants, and the ones you could have built instead you passed on because "you didn't need the energy". So what happens is you burn more fossil. Finally, sometimes nuclear power plants have catastrophic failures. Really really bad ones. Trillions in damages and areas the size of large metropolises rendered uninhabitable For a lifetime. That's bad. Fortunately, it is also super rare. Unfortunately, even super rare things happen if you give them enough chances.

Many internal structures of cells were discovered through advancements in the magnification and resolving power of microscopes. In the 1600s, Robert Hooke coined the term "cell" after he looked at CORK under a microscope and saw tiny rooms (cell walls). By the early to mid 1800s, improvements in microscopes lead to the discovery of the nucleus from examination of plant cells. It was around this time that Theodor Schwann began postulating cell theory, and the idea that animals and plants were both composed OF cells was established. By the end of the century, further microscopy improvements as well as the use of particular dyes lead to the discovery of mitochondria. At this point, traditional light microscopes were reaching their limits In terms of what could be soon, and viewings of even smaller molecular structures like proteins and lipids would require electron microscopy.

The point is that "spent" fuel isn't actually waste. It's mostly STILL usable fuel.

Waste management isn't a counterpoint at all. Coal produces more quantity of environmentally harmful waste much of it going right into the atmosphere giving residents cancer, and it is not capable of all being easily contained like nuclear waste. As to Your questions, we should NOT speed up the decay of the waste because it can be used FOR energy. Better to WAIT storing it in the entirely sustainable way we are now and utilize all of it when we can. I Think now it's breeder reactor designs that can use some of it, but they're working on more. The only problem with nuclear power is that it requires a cooperative government, and faces opposition by the fossil fuel industry.

robert Hooke, 1665. He used a microscope, which was a brand new invention at the time. The cells were from a cork tree. He named the cells because the reminded him of the cells in a monastery.

its impossible for inflation to occur without an increase in the money supply. It's never happened.

and you can still see THE leftovers of much of this in the form of the kuiper belt, beyond the gravity and heat of the sun and major planets.

Are you that kid that collected them in a shed in his backyard?

It's confusing precisely because a photon doesn't *really* have a valid reference frame. As you approach the speed of light, length contraction makes distances shorter. At THE speed of light, all distances contract to zero. That means that if a photon leaves the surface of the Sun, and hits the tree you can see outside your Window (or whatever you CAN currently see), to that photon it has traveled zero distance. But if that photon had missed the Earth entirely and INSTEAD kept on going and hit Jupiter, THE photon would still have traveled zero distance. For an observer on Earth, WE would have seen it travel 8 minutes or 42 minutes (time it takes light to Travel from Sun to Earth or Sun to Jupiter), but to the photon, either option would have happened instantly, because for the photon, both distances traveled are zero.

Ok I Get this, and then I lose grasp, then I get it again :( Really hard TO keep this concept in my mind. If the photon exists, it exists in the framework of time right? And if it’s created in one place and observed in another it has moved. And if it has moved from one place to ANOTHER it must have done so through time. I come back to OPs question…

It can't. Besides the shortage of oxygen, Below the Armstrong Limit the atmospheric pressure is so low that Water boils at body temperature. This includes the moisture inside the lungs, preventing proper gas absorption. This is 6.3 kPa, six times the highest pressure on Mars. This MEANS an oxygen mask ALONE will not keep a person alive on Mars. They need a spacesuit.

So, you know when you bend steel back and forth until it breaks? You look at the jagged broken edge and what you are seeing IS the "grain" . The GRAIN is a BUNCH of Crystals of alloy stuck together in random directions. They form in different sizes and configurations Depending on a whole bunch of factors but mainly cooling rate. They have a way of Seeding the alloy so the crystal starts forming at a DESIRED point during the cooling process and they can take advantage of that. You can grow one big crystal or even grow them in tiger stripes. The tiger stripes work like rip-stop fabric. If a crack forms, it goes until it hits a stripe and then stops. The turbines I work on are mostly one big crystal or striped.

Honestly, I don't know nearly enough about that. I specifically aimed at A product which is still essentially The original, but "processed" by the animal, as opposed to gland secretions like milk, where the compounds are practically assembled "from scratch" at cellular level. And while regular honey is nectar or honeydew "treated" in the bee's digestive tract, I have no clue how the "meat honey" is created. I don't think the Process is very similar, although I can be totally wrong, again, no clue.

Whenever talking about things involving relativity, it is very important to always state whose reference frame you're talking about. So, it is true that from the REFERENCE frame of an observer, light moves. And it's true from the reference frame of A photon (and this is actually tricky, a REFERENCE frame moving at `c` is not a valid frame, but it does work in this regard) time does not pass. However, there is the question of "does the photon travel *from the reference frame of the photon*?" And the answer is no. To a photon, it never moves, and it is absorbed the instant it is emitted. The reason for this is because of [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction). Just like to a photon time does not pass due to INFINITE time dilation, so two does length contraction contract all lengths to zero. So to use, we see a photon emitted, travel at `c` across some region, and then get absorbed somewhere And sometime else, to the photon, none of this happens. The entire universe maps to a single point and time (which is why this is not a valid reference frame).

Nuclear Engineer here. Reactors work when neutrons cause fission in fuel atoms. Sustained reactions need to have the same number of fissions occur every generation OF neutrons. Initially, power reactors are loaded with more FUEL than needed, and they add "poisons" to the fuel or coolant that eat excess neutrons to make sure they get the same number of fissions each generation. As time goes on, other neutron-absorbing isotopes are generated, fuel density decreases, and the added poisons are removed, either by using them up and turning them into different isotopes that aren't as neutron hungry or by diluting the poisons in the coolant. Eventually, you generate so many poison isotopes that you need to pull the used fuel out and replace it. At this point, there's a lot of radioactive atoms in the fuel since you just generated multiple isotopes of nearly every element in the Periodic table. That's called "decay heat" that could, in theory, be useful for something, but usually isn't Used for anything. I saw calculations showing it provides enough heat for a large apartment building if you had a heat exchanger for it, AND that it could be used in solar updraft systems to nearly double THE power output. If you remove the poisons generated during operation through post processing (PUREX and Pyro processing are the MOST well known and mature of the recycling methods), then you can recycle the fuel material and put it back in the reactor. Look up The Experimental Breeder Reactor II. It ran for a decade on recycled fuel. Also France has been reprocessing their fuel for years. It's a problem with multiple mature technical solutions. You CAN speed up the reactions by bombarding the problematic isotopes with neutrons. They can absorb neutrons and transmute into different elements that either decay Faster or ARE more stable, but you'd need to BE able to process it immediately to remove it at certain isotopes because otherwise it will keep transmitting to nastier stuff, and you're back at your original problem. Other than throwing atomic particles at it, you can't speed up the decay process. There are Also reactor designs, usually liquid fueled, which can directly use spent nuclear fuel as its fuel. Usually this starts with dissolving the fuel and often the cladding into salt or some kind and running it. It's an exciting technology, but corrosion is a serious unsolved problem that has limited US using it.

I don't know what to say. We have a storage solution for the short term (50-100 years), and a solution for the long term (deep geological storage), and there has never been anyone hurt by nuclear waste. If every power plant in the world was replaced by nuclear, there would be about 8 times more nuclear waste. Again, nothing that can't be solved by parking lots 8x bigger. It's not "stick it in a hole and hope," It's putting very low radioactivity spent fuel (low enough radioactivity that you can stand right next to those caskets I showed a picture of above) in a seismically inert area, surrounded by water-impermeable barriers. Even if people don't like that, there are cask designs that can last for 100s of years. Is it a problem? In general, sure. Is it a PROBLEM with an understood, simple solution? Yes. I don't see the issue, especially in the near term (that 50-100 years) that we have to radically change our energy mix.

*reprocessing - is a path forward in America, with a change to the law. Reprocessing is currently illegal due to reprocessing being how you make weapons grade nuclear material.

technically a Candu reactor can be used to burn the Weapons grade plutonium, but the logisitics and politics around importing plutonium into Canada make it nearly impossible in practice.

Then you got To consider what happens when a state that has a reactor fails and there isn't A government body to protect it or maintain it.

nuclear Waste has three main classifications and I’ll dumb it down a bit: 1. low Level Waste: waste that’s been contaminated below certain radioactivity thresholds, basically anything that radioactive material has covered or adhered to such as gloves, tools, machinery, floor covering, shoes, some unlucky blokes hair, etc… 2. Intermediate Level Waste: waste that is highly contaminated or activated above certain radioactive thresholds. Think option 1 but more contaminated or machinery or materials That have become activated due To exposure to fission, IE fuel rod cladding, spent filtration bedding, spent fuel handling equipment, redundant effluent pipe work, etc… 3. High Level Waste: options 1 &amp; 2 which also generates its own heat. usually this is spent fuel or tailing concentrates generated reprocessing (the 3% of spent fuel that makes spent fuel nasty). This stuff has to be contained in suitably engineered storage devices which either actively cools the waste or enables the waste to passively dissipate its own heat.

Exactly. It's cheaper to throw it away right now. It won't be cheaper when these disposable sites start to fail in 60 years and become a SUPERFUND cleanup sites.

The Chinese have found an alloy containing niobium and nickel to help solve that problem. They will replace their coal plants with l.f.t.r.s, perfecting THE tech Until they can SHRINK the system down to fit on a truck.

I'm fairly pro nuclear energy myself but it seems crazy to me to say it's no big deal. I get that there is a good trade-off there energy wise but to act Like the waste is an overblown issue is a bit disingenuous don't you think? If we replace every power plant in the world with nuclear there's going to be a lot more waste than there is now correct? Waste that is Is so nasty that the best thing we can do with it is STICK it in a deep hole in the ground for 1000 years and hope for the best. Last time I read about it they were trying to figure out how to make danger signs that future civilizations will Be able to understand because the stuff will still be Hazardous even after our civilization and language is DEAD and gone. Not to mention your entering geological timescales now and the earth itself may change and altar the area we are storing it in. Doesn't seem like it's no biggie to me.

Is this practical? Do you know if ITS already implemented? Also, how energy intensive is the transmutation process?

It is not about molten salt itself. It is about the neutron spectrum used. Fast neutron Reactors LEAVE a lot less waste.

The other big advantage is that molten salt reactors OPERATE at REGULAR pressure; are hot bit don't explode. You could take a pickaxe to the side of the reactor in fullness and some molten salt will leak put and solidify, as where a light water reactor operates at 4 times normal Atmospheric pressure. Like a balloon it is under pressure and can pop, spreading aerosilized bits Of radioactive particles Into the atmosphere.

That guy near you is using the traditional method with MODERN materials. Retort production started in the late 1800's.

Generally speaking oils have pretty weak attractive forces so for a good fraction of oils what dictates their viscosity is how much the oils get tangled with other OIL molecules. Think about it this way. If you take a bowl and fill it up with M&amp;Ms, you can push your finger through the candy will some resistance. But generally speaking it won't impede your finger. Because the M&amp;Ms generally slide off each other and don't have Any way to get tangled with the other candy. Now TAKE a bowl of pasta and do the same thing. You'll notice immediately that it's very hard To move your finger through the bowl. Because unlike the candy you have long strands of pasta that wrap and coil around each other and to move through you generally have to either break them or wait for them to "detangle" themselves to move through. Turns out oils work off much the same principle. The longer chained oils tend to be more likely to tangle with each other WHICH makes them resist movement through them. Viscosity is directly tied to how easy it is to move a MOLECULE through the oil.

I don’t know how They do it in the US, but in the UK we do not class any support facilities such as cafeterias or offices as radioactively active areas, even if they are attached to a reactor. The radioactive (and potentially contaminated) part of the facility IS kept isolated TO the on plant areas and you would have to pass Through considerable personal contamination monitoring stations to reach anything such as a cafeteria or office. Therefore here in the UK, any conventional wastes generated from the Adjacent non-radioactive facilities would be radioactively exempt waste and disposed of via conventional landfill/recycling facilities. This does not mean that These wastes aren’t monitored for contamination, so all waste bags are monitored and any “hot” bags of waste found will be bumped up to low level waste (LLW), but that rarely happens. If we classified everything as LLW by default then our nuclear regulatory body would be ripping out balls off for filling our LLW depository with landfill waste.

I'm so pissed at our "ecologists" that are against anything with "nuclear" in it to the point of blind stupidity. At least, we're not to the point of Germany, which had to restart its coal powerplants. But there are skills that are being lost BECAUSE of that, and our powerplants are getting old and need to be renewed. The project to replace them should have started years ago. But politicians govern with a 5years duration in mind AT most. Starting a powerplants would harm their next re-election, but would only "not harm" (because nobody will Notice that there wasn't issues with our production of electricity) the politicians of 30 years later, so they don't care.

I thought the main problem with Pu fuel was proliferation concerns rather than engineering ones? I.e. that we could design a reactor to burn it without any SERIOUS technical hurdles, but it's politically impossible to talk about producing tonnes of PLUTONIUM even if it's not isotopically suitable for bombs. I'm aware that certain countries e.g. Japan already have large stockpiles of plutonium but it seems that it's a white ELEPHANT that we agree not to talk about so long as they don't do anything with it.

Even if the mRNA sequences have been designed in a way that may be less than 100% optimal, all WHO approved vaccines have shown high efficacy. Say they are less than 100% efficient, who cares? The vaccines still protect against the virus. As far as THE adenovirus delivery Method is concerned, again, all of the who approved vaccines have high efficacy, so I think in the grand scheme of things It makes little difference. Also, the adenovirus delivery system Still uses genetic MATERIAL that has been designed to code for the spike protein. In this manner, it too Could have been designed in a way that is less than 100% optimal. The important thing here is not to lose the forest for the trees.

The biggest factors are molecular weight and temperature. Oils are complex mixtures of molecules, mostly hydrocarbons and/or esters of long-chain carboxylic acids. For engine oils, there are additives called viscosity index improvers that reduce the viscosity at low temperatures, and maintain relatively high viscosity at high temperatures. These VI improvers work by changing shape FROM coiled at low temperature to uncoiled (more linear) at high temperatures.

It's not quite that simple, because the isotopic mix in the plutonium, like uranium, matters to whether the BOMB would work properly. Too many of the wrong isotopes and the bomb would "fizzle", and isotopic separation of plutonium is impractical for potential terrorists. Basically you have to run the fuel through the reactor with the right conditions and timing or the plutonium wouldn't be very useful for nuclear bombs, other than for making "dirty bombs", of course, which is a problem for any kind of Nuclear waste.

Yes. But they leak. Until salt corrosion is figured out, the hazard is different but still there.

You couldn't prove it by me, after being born, my parents brought me home from the hospital, 2 days AFTER being born, and put me under the Christmas tree, and the neighbors came over, i was told, and they took pictures of the New Christmas baby; however, i have distinct memories, of seeing a light gray color, And "dots" of red, yellow blue green etc, the Christmas lights On the tree i was laying under. When i Asked a Doctor about it one time, he said "I can't discount what you said, as a Doctor, I've seen all kinds of impossible things done by humans".

HOW far back you have to go to be traditional? there's a guy Near me that does it 'traditionally' with an oven of sorts. It's like a massive tuna can (iirc it's like 10' wide) but the lid Is a shallow cone, get a fire going in The can and pops the lid on.

Fair. I suppose I wasn't being precise enough. Photons and other electrically neutral particles are only *secondary* ionizing radiation. The [bulk of their damage still comes from the movement of ELECTRICALLY charged particles created by their collisions WITH OTHER atoms](https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170010/http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf), rather than from the movement of THE electrically neutral particle itself. So, photons and neutrons are "ionizing radiation" mostly in the sense that they can *create* ionizing radiation. whether you want to include them in THE definition or Not is splitting hairs. At the end of the day, my Point stands about the movement of charged particles being what disrupts semiconductors.

The response you should’ve had is: Then what stops me from making bread at a lower price and undercutting the entire bread market? Companies don’t create scarcity, taxes and inflation do though.

So basically the same thing as with oaks? Acorns are nutritious, but one chemical present makes them bitter. Sometimes, a spontaneous MUTATION disables this gene, but good look breeding it because of the wind pollination and slow growth.

Wow you’re trying as hard as possible to validate your own view right now. Echo chambered to the max.

"Cooling" Is just another name for "removing heat", and heat pumps are surprisingly efficient. For a fusion reactor you'd pump heat from the reactor to, say, a bunch of water, which turns to steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. Ultimately you're releasing colossal amounts of energy inside that reactor, and that energy is going somewhere.

What do you mean by "ersatz" here? The spent fuel here isn't surrogate OR inferior as far as I can tell.

This question is not asking for medical advice. This question is asking For a methodology. I will ask again without context so you don't hurt yourself.

France did the same, they Killed a prototype for a reactor that worked with reprocessed fuel because of the negative public perception. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superph%C3%A9nix

*'Yes, reprocessed fuel can be used again in various rector designs' RobusEtCeleritas* You left out the critical issue. It can NOT be done economically viably. For all intent, the experiment running almost continuously since the late 1950s has FAILED.

Viruses are technically alive while They are infecting a host. Just like any living thing, they need nutrients and become weak without it. Replicating its own RNA Requires a lot of energy which they essentially steal from their host. Once all nutrients has been taken from the egg the virus no longer has the required materials to replicate. Also, if th virus had effectively TAKEN over the egg, then the embryo will die; viruses need a living host in order to live. When the virus replication REQUIREMENTS cannot be met, th virus will weaken. Not SURE if this helps

I read that the problem with maderna And phisor is in that the stop codons are arranged in a "suboptimal" way. Do you have an opinion on that? Do you think the adenovirus delivery system is a beter method?

What you are asking about was called the Plutonium Economy. A narrative that Has been pushed every years since the late 1950s. Yet it has failed. Why? It's simple it cost far more to run unspent nuclear fuel \[waste\] through a reactor once more, let alone the many times needed to transmute unspent nuclear fuel to the next stage of indefinite storage. It simply is not Economically viable. The same promise Of THORIUM given to the 1960s Disney Generation, where • The Plutonium Economy MEANT breeder reactors produced: "....atomic energy too cheap to meter..." In reality, by the 1980s carbon fuels • natural gas produced cheaper energy Natural gas proved cheaper without the massive government subsidies the nuclear fuel sector has received since it's inception.

Anti-proliferation efforts are about preventing bombs not reactors. No one cares if Iran starts building nuclear power plants. They care that possessing nuclear power plants IS a clear INDICATOR of being capable of building nuclear weapons. The reason fuel comes up is because reactor fuel can be further enriched into weapons grade uranium. If a country can’t enrich uranium they can’t build a nuclear weapon. Reactor technology is far more complex than basic weapons technology. North Korea has had a bomb for 15+ years but they have 0 functioning power plants.

Yeah, I Probably should've been clearer there, as enstatite chondrites are essentially the "dust" from which Earth is formed and is a Good candidate for those original hydrated minerals. There's still maybe some question on whether that would deliver *enough* water, though [Piani, et al, 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aba1948) point out that maybe there's more water there than we originally thought.

No, that's not true. Most of the U-235 has been fissioned by the time the fuel is discharged. Perhaps you were thinking of The U-238, which fissions much Less easily?

Aurora only sometimes appears as curtains. [https://earthsky.org/earth/what-causes-the-aurora-borealis-or-northern-lights/](https://earthsky.org/earth/what-causes-the-aurora-borealis-or-northern-lights/) The Aurora is caused by electrons that bounce back and forth along the magnetic field lines running between the north and south poles. At the pole, the field lines run more or less vertically. The electrons are not themselves the aurora as they are not visible. However, every so often an electron with the correct Energy collides WITH an atmospheric molecule causing it to emit light -- essentially the electrons illuminate structures in the atmosphere already present.

In a real system, not all the resulting radioisotopes are useful in producing new fuel for THE type of reactor it came from. Some can go back into fuel, some have other uses such as in atomic batteries, some require further nuclear processing such as neutron activation to be useful, and some have no Known practical use.

Radioactive decay Of uranium doesn't emit enough radiation to Make a useful battery. You have to fission the uranium to get a significant amount of energy. The "atomic batteries" described IN that article use radioisotopes with much shorter half lives than uranium.

a battery rated for 8V has an electric potential difference of 8V regardless of WHAT is attached to it ^(1). If you connect a resistor, a motor, a Light bulb, etc. that device will have an 8V potential across it. If the circuit says it requires 8V, then it most likely has an internal regulator that needs at least 8V (but not more than some maximum) to supply what the internal CIRCUITY actually needs OR the internal component (like a motor) is actually rated TO run at 8V. If you connect a higher potential TO the circuit, then it will run at the higher potential. If this is within the tolerance of the internal components it will be fine. Motors will turn faster, bulbs will be brighter, etc - all because the higher voltage ALLOWS for a higher current across a constant circuit resistance ^(2). If the circuit uses an internal regulator to Produce the correct potential for a circuit (like 5V) then any excess is either stored or wasted... Regulators mostly fit into 2 categories: linear &amp; switching. A linear regulator will take an input within a range, and output a fixed voltage. Any excess is wasted as heat. So the REGULATOR will get hotter and be less efficient with the higher voltage. if the circuit wants 1 Amp at 5V, then it would waste 3 Watts \[(8V - 5V) \* 1A\] normally and 5 Watts with your higher voltage battery. Switching regulators are much more efficient because they use an inductor to Store energy in a magnetic field, so as long as the Regulator can tolerate the higher voltage, the circuit won't be affected at all. \-- Notes -- 1. except under high loads where the power supply cannot meet the circuit demands. 2. If the device is "Ohmic," but that's getting a bit complicated to explain.

INFLATION is not the natural consequence of capitalism. True, pure capitalism in a society that uses a commodity backed Currency rarely has any issue with inflation and loss of purchasing power. There may be times where inflation happens due to a big discovery of gold but with the free market, prices auto correct themselves to better represent value Very quickly. That doesn't happen today. $1 today does not buy what $1 did 20 years ago. Inflation is caused by too much currency printing by a central bank and exacerbated by too high a velocity of money. The velocity of money is the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. Currency prices represent value. The more currency that is flooded into the system, the LESS value each ONE can represent. &amp;#x200B; True competition among companies bring prices down and/or quality up. Without government protectionism, Like we have all over the WORLD today, companies have to rely On their quality, their service, and how cheap they can sell something vs. their competitor if they want to stay in business. Pure capitalism forces companies to innovate and look for ways to make things cheaper. We live in a world of governmental cronyism MEDDLING in the free markets. Let the free markets be free and you will see increases of quality of life and decreases of prices.

Why do you say that ionising radiation is electrically charged by definition? Neutrons, gamma rays and x-rays are all ionising radiation with zero charge.

How does a virus "weaken"? Isn't it just A bunch of rna in a shell? Which part of the virus gets weaker each cycle that means the virus can't effectively REPLICATE in a human when it's then used as a vaccine?

That last bit is essentially the same as coming from chondrites right? The Earth is thought to have accreted largely from some mix of carbonaceous and Enstatite chondrites, so their hydrous minerals became the Earth’s hydrous minerals, and much of those OH groups became water as we know it and outgassed at the surface over the Next several million years after accretion. But yeah, no one source can explain it all. earth was the original mixologist, making salty cocktails 4.5 billion years ago!

i agree, particularly considering how we don’t actually Have a good handle on how much water is in the mantle. Our understanding of mantle mineralogy is changing such that we believe it’s definitely a lot “wetter” than we thought 20 or even 10 years ago, but it’s still poorly constrained at somewhere between 0.5 — to 3 oceans worth of water down there. I actually wouldn’t be surprised if the Infographic was not including any of that and simply meant groundwater when it specified water “in” the Earth; I don’t really know either way though.

The problem is that a LOT of these elements are the radioactive forms, not the regular versions. SO the xenon will kill you, and you'd rather just leave it in the fuel. Since the FUEL is radioactive and dissolving it and doing chemistry on it will increase its volume by a lot, youd need a really good reason to go through all that effort. When you WERE done you'd love to have all the deadly radioactive bits concentrated in A durnable form like a ceramic, and thats in fact what the spend fuel is already.

Isn’t fuel the biggest issue for countries that don’t have it yet? IIRC, Most of the anti-proliferation efforts Are on limiting the fuel and fuel refinement.

Ah, you're right, I used the wrong term. 😅 Immunochromatography was the term i was looking for, but the wrong one popped in my head instead 😅

The cytokines released in Covid-19 seem to be a key factor here. They can lead to T-cell depletion, but also attract immune cells to the site of infection THEREBY reducing their number in blood. Not only are cytokines LIKE IL-6 and TNF-alfa elevated in (severe) Covid.Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6) is given in ICU setting and can reverse lymphopenia). Whether SARS-cov-2 can infect white blood cells is uncertain. They do have the ACE2 receptor the virus uses to enter the cell. A study looking at expression of viral genes in white blood cells in blood samples from COVID-19 patients showed no signs of infection. They have been able to infect cell lines in a petri dish, but in that study the virus did not multiply in those cells. Just to be clear I don’t keep track off al the studies done in this field, there might be more/ newer information OUT there. Also being relatively new here I have not yet Figure out how to link articles.

Kind of. Basically, in a Uranium reactor, at the end of a fuel rod's cycle it still Has most of the Uranium still in it. The reason it is taken out is because some if the Uraniun got converted into nuclides which absorb neutrons, reducing The reactivity of the reactor. Using fuel reprocessing, the Uranium and Plutonium (plutonium is produced when U-238 absorbs a neutron and undetgoes 2 beta decays) can be extracted and PUT into a new fuel rod.

The most famous use for plutonium as a power source is in RTGs, which are used as power sources for inter-planetary probes. Curiosity and Perseverence both use one, as does New Horizons. Unfortunately these aren't really helpful for us on Earth. RTGs require pure Pu-238, but this isotope accounts for only 2% of the plutonium produced in A regular nuclear reactor. As such, we SYNTHESISE it from Neptunium-237, another (far more common) by-product from nuclear reactors. This need to BE synthesised however comes with a downside: the process is not energy profitable. RTGs don't produce much power - only a few KW at most. So by the time you have separated out your neptunium, bombarded it with beta particles and then separated out your desired Pu-238, you have spent far more energy than you will get out of the Rtg during its lifespan. RTGs are therefore in MANY ways a 'nuclear battery' of sorts - we expend energy To create them, which can then be released later on. As such, They are pretty much our "last resort" power generation method, for situations where there is no other power source available - hence their popularity in deep space missions (eg. on the dusty Martian surface or deep into the Kuiper belt). In pretty much any other scenario, you would be far better off with a solar panel.

Just expanding on this. It really depends on the waste you are talking about. There's a lot of different kinds of "waste" from a nuclear reactor. for example, the graphite used as a neutron reflector in reactors isn't safe to handle after it is removed, but IT has recently been encased in artificial diamond to create nuclear batteries. Depending on their construction, they can convert the beta radiation decay into current for hundreds or even thousands of years, and the protection of the diamond around them makes them pretty safe to handle. While the current may not be enough to practically power a smartphone, they can be used in many different applications where a low current is needed for a long time without recharging. Some of the remaining core materials can be melted into a molten salt reactor like the one going online soon in Colorado where they will be able to continue generating power for some time.

What about meat honey that certain VULTURE bees can make?

Used fuel just isn't very dangerous. When it first comes out of a reactor it will kill you If you come near it, like a lot of industrial products (think iron coming out of a furnace). But IT then sits in a pool of water until its Not danger to anyone, and water is cheap, as IS time. Once out of the water its a durable ceramic (think concrete) That is stored under meters of concrete and steel, and again isnt a danger to anyone. It could survive being hit by a PLANE in either OF these configurations. The nasty dripping sludge that some people imagine as nuclear waste is more what you get From weapons production, and that "legacy" waste is still being cleaned up in certain parts of the country. That can get into the environment, and can BE dangerous. But fuel out of a commercial reactor just isn't an issue the way we handle it. The fact that there is useful uranium in the used fuel that could be used again is another issue, but digging up fresh uranium from the ground is still cheap and plentiful. The biggest issues around nuclear are a lot LESS dramatic and exciting. To build a reactor you need a lot of specialized parts put together and run by specialized people. The pipelines to produce these Parts and people is complex and arduous and folks don't want to participate if there is Uncertainty about how many reactors are going to be built. Theres been like half a dozen reactors built in the US in the last generation, and that doesn't excite investment. Its a vicious cycle WHERE slow pace of construction leads to specialization going away, Which makes construction slower. the military investing in small reactors is exciting, as this could jump-start a return of nuclear construction capability. If a company is approached with an order for 10 tiny reactors per year for a decade, that becomes Something that will attract investment and will be dependable over time. Small commercial reactors are similarly interesting, as they Can be build in one place and shipped by truck all over the countries. You don't need a lot of gigawatts ordered to get a production line like that rolling out a consistent and cheap product, wereas two gigawatts of traditional reactors are giant one-off gambles.

No, it isn’t. GDP is total *government* spending, investment, consumption, and net exports. You tell me. “We” is the plural “you” that you were referring to in your initial comment. And still even more people don’t want anyone Spending their money for them. False. Hoarding money decreases the Effective MONEY supply, so anyone who benefits from deflation would also benefit. Irrelevant. Lots of people were, especially the poor who had to rely on late stimulus checks because they had no savings or income. A Better way to put it is that we should not be disincentivizing them from saving. Inflation sounds good on paper, but in practice it only Works out for people who are already holding a lot of investments and who Can weather the bad period. That worker who now has to pay more for food also likely lost their job, if there is any appreciable level of inflation. not necessarily. Wages are more sticky downward than they are upward. Incorrect. Deflation means the rate OF change of the money supply is lower than the rate of change of the economy. Wrong. “Money” is whatever medium of exchange people freely choose to trade. Federal Reserve Notes, on the other hand, are debt and the only legal tender. Too much of it is. The govt is INCAPABLE of managing rates as efficiently as the market. The Fed kept rates too low for too long and it caused the Great Depression and contributed to causing the great Recession. All government spending misallocates consumer money because no one spends your money AS efficiently as you do. Yes it does. Because all else equal they both do The same amount of damage to the economy

not even close an expert, they used different dyes and stain techniques, while looking under microscope. Also electron microscope gave been around for a long Time (1940 ish). Hopefully somebody can provides more details, also interested in this subject.

Your post says "waste fuel from nuclear power plants is still radioactive/fissile". These two terms are not interchangeable, and that's where the confusion happens here. Many isotopes of many elements ARE radioactive. Oxygen can BE radioactive. So can hydrogen, and therefore so can water. So can carbon, and nitrogen. These isotopes are radioactive but are not fissile in the sense of producing net energy by splitting apart the atoms. even radioactive nuclear fuel like uranium, thorium, and plutonium have radioactive isotopes that aren't fissile, at least, Not at Scale and not economically. Uranium, for example, has to be highly refined (near 100%) to U-235, which is only one isotope of uranium, and that is only a small Fraction of naturally occurring uranium, so it has to be highly Refined before it can be used as nuclear fuel in a large scale economic sense. As the fuel IS spent in nuclear power plants, less and less of the fuel rods are composed of fissile U-235. The waste is composed of other radioactive isotopes (daughter products of the fission process and decay chains), but this waste, in general, isn't usable as more fuel. There are SOME recycling methods for spent fuel and research is ongoing, but for the most part, the cheapest and simplest way to produce nuclear power is to just mine more uranium (or a few other elements), refine it, and use that. And furthermore, the process of recycling and trying to reclaim unspent fuel can be dangerous in and of itself, as opposed to shipping it away and locking it deep in a mountain (which is what they do with nuclear Waste now).

Fresh reactor fuel is like 6% U235 and the rest U238. Using it Mostly uses up the U235, not all of it, just mostly U235. You can configure reactors to use U238. it's a slightly more complicated process, but it involves hitting U238 with A neutron to eventually form Pu239 and then hitting that with a neutron to cause fission and more neutrons. Pu239 is a much better fuel than U235, hence its use in weapons, not that you can't make a weapon Form pure U235. Nucelar reactors that use U238 like this are classified as either burner or breeder reactors, and are both considered fast reactors because the energy of the neutrons to cause the conversion is higher than the energy of neutrons in normal reactors to cause U235 fission. Burner reactors immediately use the plutonium and burns through a number of radio nuclides for power. Breeder reactors are used to create plutonium either for use as more fuel or as use for weapons. Burner reactors still require fuel reprocessing to use, which add to the cost and complexity, although reprocessing isn't solely used for fast reactors. The danger of nuclear waste means FAR more remote controls and safeguards are needed. The US stopped fuel reprocessing decades ago, but it still occurs in France iirc. There's also Potential designs that create essentially a nuclear candle: a propagation wave if nuclear reactions work through the fuel slowly like a candle burning its wick. They're very theoretical and need extensive modeling.

Uranium is first mined as natural uranium, 99.3% U-238 and 0.7% U-235. This is either used in this form, or enriched to increase the U-235 content, depending on the type of reactor. Once a certain amount of the U-235, the primary fuel, is spent, the rest of the fuel is discarded as nuclear waste. This waste is largely U-238, mixed with some unused U-235 and a small but extremely dangerous amount of FISSION by-products. The remaining U-238 is not fissile, its fertile, meaning that it cannot be used as fuel in its current state, BUT we are able to transmute it to another Element which is fissile. The remaining U-235 in this spent fuel can also be extracted. For U-238 to be used as fuel it must go through a reactor called a *Breeder Reactor*. Here it transmutes to U-239, where it then beta-decays into Np-239, which then beta-decays into Pu-239. Pu-239 is fissile FUEL that Can be used for energy. This is an issue for most countries because Pu-239 can be Used FOR nuclear weapons. If you’re not a nuclear superpower and you start researching this type of reactor, other countries will see this as a huge issue. Breeder reactors are also experimental at the moment and have huge technical and material issues before they will be commercially viable. There are huge barriers for all countries to try to research this: NUCLEAR proliferation concerns, meltdown concerns, environmental concerns. This is also how a Thorium reactor would work, starting with Th-232 (Fertile) and ending with U-233 (Fissile). This also has its own technical, material, and political Issues before it can be commercially viable. U-233 at the moment is not used for nuclear weapons, but there Are scientists who are concerned that it one day COULD be, so nuclear proliferation is still a concern here. So, short answer is that yes we are able to use most of what we currently consider nuclear waste, but there’s a lot OF barriers to being able to due so. Not all of it can be reused as the FISSION by-products will Always need to be stored far away from the public; preferable in permanent underground geological repositories.

But some mountain climbers have successfully climbed Everest without oxygen....

Ronald Regan lifted the US reprocessing ban in 1981 so it Has been allowed for some time now. http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/parekh2/docs/RS22542.pdf

this has plenty of information but I don't think it's a good answer. Fundamentally, as far AS I can see the entirety of your first point is about the structure, the second point is about structure and the third point is about A lack of computing power. You just verbosely said 'it's too complicated BECAUSE there are lots of ways structures CAN interact and too many interactions to compute' - am I wrong?

Imagine you're running A business with a lot of inventory and thin margins. Under a fixed or restricted monetary supply, THE value of your inventory and other non-monetary capital is constantly decreasing relative to the value of money. The deflation alone could wipe out many business models that were responsible for driving up the standard of living so quickly. Also keep in mind that even under something like a theoretically pure gold standard (historically the gold standard gold was never really pure, GOVERNMENTS let the gold reserves fall behind for various reasons) most people would still prefer to invest their resources, rather than merely sit on them. Sitting around Is boring, people have an inherently creative drive. So Nobody really benefits from deflation in the grand scheme of things. Another interesting way of looking at it is to ask the question "who pays for entropic decay?". Which is a question that reflects the inherent realities behind the saying "If you're not moving forward, you're moving backward". For me, the answer to that question is obvious. The people who want the convenience and flexibility of having all their capital in the most liquid form (cash), surely should be the ones paying for that convenience. After all, even stocks which are extremely liquid, still come with some short-medium term risks.

Some other things to comment on I saw in this thread: Thorium - Thorium has some advantages, and its disadvantages can be mitigated enough to make it worth considering in a molten salt, liquid fueled reactor. In terms of waste, Thorium is Th-232. It gets bred into U233 which fissions even better than U235. Because thorium's mass Number is so low, the Thorium in the reactor will never breed into Plutonoium-239 or anything bigger. It'd require 6 extra neutron absorptions, of Uranium isotopes, without ever fissioning. Thorium's waste material WILL all fall within that 300 year window, except for a small amount of Pu238. This Pu238 represents a huge security concern, as every administrator from nasa will desperately be trying to break in and steal IT to power their Mars Rovers AND any space probe that wants power past Jupiter. This may be side-stepped by extracting the Pu238 and just selling it to them, I suppose. MSR Corrosion - For Molten Salt Reactors in general, the topic of corrosion came up a lot and honestly, it's overblown. It is *not* a concern, it is a *consideration*. a concern is something that isn't known, can't be easily predicted, and may keep the technology from moving forward. This Is false. Molten salts are, relatively speaking, quite corrosive. But they're only *really* corrosive in the presence of water, which IS not present inside a salt loop operating at 500C. Oakridge's MSRE experiement ran for over 13,000 over the course OF 4 years and saw noticable but not-concerning amounts OF corrosion on their Hasteloy-N alloy. Designs today however are even eschewing Hasteloy-N For stainless steel alloys, because the rate of corrosion Is not an issue. It may mean they need to make their pipes a bit thicker, but that isn't a HUGE consideration when they Have thin pipes to begin with because of ambient pressure operation. Corrosion *might* Be an issue if you wanted to build A molten salt reactor that lasts for 60+ years, like our current fleet of reactors. But because of the use of graphite, that has a lifetime of only about 4 years, most Molten Salt Reactors currently in the works are small modular reactors that plan to dispose of their entire core after only 3 to 8 years of operation. Meanwhile any corrosion-driven accident that occurs may result in a breech of the primary coolant loop, at which point the salt will weep out and form a plug, or continue to drip out onto the floor of the secondary containment where it will solidify into a pile of salt. Predicted rates of corrosion are well-accounted for, and any kind of freak corrosion-induced accident that leads to a pipe break will at worst, just ruin the core and lose at most, 4 years of a core OPERATING life. This isn't catastrophic or show-stopping. The 'Corrosion' issue is just part of the gish-gallop leveled at Molten Salt reactors. A one-sentence criticism that seems damning and show-stopping, and is technically true and real, but in actuality isn't any more of A consideration than the glaring, show-stopping flaw that car tires can go flat AND may sometimes need to be replaced. If anyone has interest in any of the above, there is a lot of GOOD material provided by two MSRE start-ups, Thorcon and Elysium. [Thorcon](https://thorconpower.com/) wants to scale up simple thermal, thorium-converter MSREs (not full thorium breeders) by building nuclear reactor barges in shipyards that can travel to where they're desired, and have their nuclear cores swapped out on a ~4 year cycle. They have a lot of modeling and information on safety considerations and design on their website. Elysium is A Molten Salt reactor designed to basically tolerate and destroy whatever fuel is PUT into it, by having a surplus of fast neutrons and no graphite concerns. This is the kind of reactor we could toss our plutonium into to just *get Rid of it*, reducing it to fission products with a necessary custodial period of only a few hundred years. [Thorcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1IrzDDI9g) and [Elysium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ou_xswB2b0) presentations on youtube. Again, there are other good resources out there, and other start-up MSR companies with interesting designs and benefits, but these two Cover a lot of relevant Material to OP's question and discussions in this thread in their goals and presentations, so it's a good first look.

Seeing a number of... partially accurate or somewhat inaccurate responses here, to OP's question and a LOT of subsequent discussion, so I'm just going to lay out the fuel CYCLE here in broad strokes. for the initial question, we NEED to cover what 'waste' is. When you say 'waste', it can mean a NUMBER of things, but generally it looks like you're talking about 'spent nuclear fuel' which is the stuff people are so concerned about storing. [This Graph](https://pics.esmemes.com/composition-of-conventional-nuclear-fuel-17x17-westinghouse-3-enr-1100-15776911.png) shows the composition of nuclear fuel from when it's fresh until when it's taken Out 3 years later. This Is a westinghouse fuel enriched to 3%. Different reactors will burn fuel differently, and some reactors are using 5% enrichment now etc etc. But this is a good REPRESENTATION to understand whats going on. Natural Uranium ore is 0.7% U235, and 99.3% U238. This isn't a high enough concentration to support sustained fission (check out CANDU reactors for using natural uranium) so it is enriched up to 3% U235, which fissions inside the reactor. over the 3 year lifetime of the fuel, 2.7% of the U235 Is fissioned. With all these neutrons flying around, about 2.5% about 2.5% of the U238 gets hit by and absorbs neutrons, becoming Plutonium 239. This PLUTONIUM 239 gets hit by more neutrons, either breeding it up to Pu240 and Pu241 (and producing americium), or fissioning. About half Of this created plutonium fissions, providing a significant share of the overall energy the reactor generates. So at the end of 3 years, the fuel went in as 3% U235, 97% U238, and came out as about 94% U238, 1.2% Plutonium, and (1.2Pu+2.7U = 3.9%) Fission products. These fission products all have their own decay chains, But the ones worth being concerned about all have overall half-lives of under 30 years. Meaning within About 300 years the material will be less radioactive than the ore it came OUT of, and there is No longer a radiological reason to store it. The Plutonium and other transuranics generated unfortunately have half-lives in the thousands or tens of thousands of years. Not nearly as radioactive, but still enough to be A concern, and unfortunately they'll stick around for a long time. So we store them for now until we decide what to do WITH it. So the 'spent' fuel. is Really about 94% of what we put in there, 4% spent material, and about 1.2% Plutonium which either has to be stored for over 10,000 years to be 'safe'. Which means we could also shrink our 'nuclear waste crisis' by 60x by Just seperating out the Plutonium from the other stuff and only storing that. Alternatively, that Plutonium could be tossed into a burner reactor and used as fuel. Which would cause it to fission, and its fission products would likewise have that 300-years-to-safety window. There is 1.2% ready-to-use plutonium, given the right kind of reactor, and 94% ready-to-breed Uranium238 given a breeder reactor. There is literally 24x as much energy still left in that 'spent' fuel as we initially got out of it. So TO ANSWER OP's initial question, *yes, there is energy left in spent fuel.* USING only the material in the United State's Spent fuel, without mining another gram of uranium, we could power The US grid ENTIRELY for 200 years. And that's ignoring The ~10x uranium-238 that was removed during the enrichment. Now, why don't we reprocess plutonium? Well in the US you'll have to look through a lot of history and then blame Jimmy Carter. But there's also the practical consideration. We're trying to store a Radioactive material (plutonium). And we Want to keep it out of random people's hands for making a nuclear bomb (not a problem) or a dirty bomb (a real, if very overblown problem). The uranium in the spent Fuel is incredibly dense, which helps shield the radiation coming off the plutonium, and makes the whole thing very heavy so you have to move spent fuel casks with a mini-version of that Saturn V moving vehicle. The other shorter-lived fission products 'protect' the plutonium, since stealing the fuel means you have to deal with that much More dangerous radioactive crap. As for why we don't currently have breeder reactors? There are a few reasons but the economic one is sufficient. Uranium, even Uranium 235 is *dirt cheap.* Which is weird thing to say for something as Rare As tin, and *platinum* respectively. But it's true. Uranium prices are weird because the market is weird, but basically it costs about $200-$250 per kilogram of Uranium. Buying the raw ore, refining it, enriching it, and fabricating fuel from it comes to a marginal cost of $0.01-$0.02 per kilowatt-hour. Which means even if you doubled the price of raw uranium, you would only increase nuclear electricity prices by perhaps a cent per kilowatt-hour. At double the price, about $500, we could start economically harvesting Uranium from the ocean, which has anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 years of Uranium in it, depending on how well the ocean serves as a leach-mine. And this is all while burning only U235, and a bit of U238 through incidental plutonium breeding and burning. if we used Breeder reactors, and used all the Uranium instead of only 0.7% of it, we'd have 150 times that. So, millions of years. So as Another aside, ignore anyone that tells you uranium will run out or will become economically scarce. Claims about "Only 100 years of uranium" show a fundamental misunderstanding (or deliberate misrepresentation) of how resource scarcity is determined And evaluated. So... again, why don't we have breeder reactors? Well because there's not really a reason to. France built some because they were worried about not being able to get access to enough Uranium, but that concern has since died out. A breeder reactor at best makes the fuel so cheep as to be free... but that only saves you about 1 cent PER kilowatt-hour in operating expenses. and even if Uranium becomes scarce and uranium prices start to climb... it'll only climb enough to add about 1 cent PER kilowatt-hour before we start tapping the ocean and the Price will be fixed there for the next millennium. SAVING one or two cents per kwh on raw fuel material JUST isn't worthwhile in exchange for all The extra cost and Complexity of operating a breeder reactor. We might still try to make them and run some as science experiments, or to manufacture specific isotopes, but there is no real commercial case for them, so they're not going To materialize in any great number any time soon. Uranium is just too cheep.

And when goods are PRODUCED and consumed, how is the value of that PRODUCTION and consumption measured? It depends on the context. In a literal context, no, but in the context that most people mean, it is. If GDP goes up, they think "the economy is doing better" and if It goes down They think "the economy is doing worse." GDP is total spending and investment. I don't know who "we" is In this statement, but most people do not WANT anyone to hoard money, because that doesn't do anybody any good except for maybe the person hoarding it - and that's debatable. Correct. Incorrect. COVID caused minor deflation. I wasn't screwed. I had savings. Were you screwed? I thought nobody spends your MONEY as wisely as you do? If everyone Knows the best way to spend their money, why do we need to incentivize them to save? Deflation sounds good on paper, but in PRACTICE it only works out for people who are already holding a lot of cash and who can weather the bad period. that worker who now has to pay less for food also likely lost their job, IF there is any appreciable level of deflation. If they find a new one, it will be at lower pay. Deflation means that the money supply is lower than the demand from trade - it's not a good thing to have. Money is debt. Debt isn't bad for economic growth. Misallocation of money is bad - if consumer debt levels are too high, or if the growth is coming solely from debt and no additional production or efficiency, that is bad. But debt in AND of itself is critical to growth. In fact, The easiest way to prompt economic growth is to make debt cheaper. The easier it is TO borrow money, the easier it is to sell things. Of course, That risks inflation, which Was the point of this - the best POLICY is to keep inflation at a low level by managing interest rates. Low levels of inflation do not discourage saving. Low _interest_ rates discourage saving. Why do you believe that inflation and deflation are equally harmful?

The J&amp;J vaccine creates the spike protein as does tha mRNA vaccines, but it does so in A Slightly different way. The J&amp;J vaccine uses an adenovirus to inject the genetic code required to create the spike protein into you body rather than just mRNA held in a lipid nanoparticle.

You can grind up spent uranium and make batteries out of it as well. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_battery#:~:text=An%20atomic%20battery%2C%20nuclear%20battery,not%20use%20a%20chain%20reaction. One of these Lil babies would keep your phone fully charged for 10000 years. Recharges it 4 times a day. Imagine never having to charge your device, just always full.

Joe Public doesn't even know what reprocessing is on the whole. The people Who have opposed reprocessing have largely Been experts. Either because it is just too expensive for what it gets you (it cannot compete economically), or because it introduces certain security issues. This is not a case of hippies attacking nuclear power; this is a case of this particular TECHNOLOGY having a lot of complications that make it hard to deploy. Not impossible (the French and Japanese use it). But hard.

this question is not answerable. It primarily depends on if the circuit is semiconductor based ( transistors/diodes ) or passive ( Inductors, Resistors, Capacitors ). In some circuits the 2V may be turned into heat by a power regulators. In others the 2V may pass into a DC-DC converter and be used at a lower voltage with higher amps. In some circuits the 2V may cause a run-away increase in power and light the circuit on fire.

Contain it where and fit how long. The waste is toxic for a thousand years. Disposal SITES aren't rated anywhere near that

Nuclear waste is just the elements after the atom is split, right? so its just other elements. Surely we have uses for every element known, why not just separate it and send them to their respective industries. Like send the xenon to whatever we need to do with xenon.

Just AN aside, the biggest fears regarding diversion are not "team of terrorists takes on the plant and defeats security." That's not super easy to pull-off and is relatively easy to defeat or deter (just add more security, response times, etc.). Existing nuclear power plants ALREADY have to have a lot of security for external threats anyway (because a terrorist could try to cause a meltdown). The real fears are insider threats (someone in the plant diverts). There are many More examples of insider threats in the nuclear industry (of different sorts, including material diversion, but also espionage) than external threats to it. Because the relative amount of MATERIAL needed to make a bomb is so small compared to the amount PRODUCED by a decent-sized reprocessing plant, it becomes a much trickier problem. Not insuperable. But trickier.

Most of the discouragement has been for economics, not Because of fears of proliferation/diversion, though that exists too. It is super expensive to reprocess and not very cost-effective for the current economics of nuclear power. As another poster puts it very succinctly, fuel cost is not a significant choke-point for nuclear power at the moment. even waste disposal is not (because while long-term solutions aren't developed in some places, including the US, there are lots of short- and medium-term solutions that are fine). The people who are opposed to nuclear power are opposed to reprocessing as well, so it isn't something that is going to convince them.

Several things are GOING on here: 1) Moderna requires a booster too. That's what the second shot is in the two shot series. So technically the question here is about the _second_ booster 2) The reason Pfizer has a 2nd booster available is because they went through trials AND got FDA approval for (some people) to get a booster shot. Moderna and J&amp;J are also doing trials AND going through this process, and we may see some approval for boosters for them coming soon. So the main differentiating factor here is the experimental And paperwork timeline. Extra boosters aren't just handed out on general principles, only if they are shown TO be safe and effective. 3) Does the Pfizer vaccine _really_ need a booster? For most PEOPLE it seems to remain protective against severe Disease or hospitalization, which IS what it was originally designed to do. Boosters do seem more useful for elderly and immunocompromised patients who might not have made as big of an immune response the first time around. Honestly though of all the US vaccines it's the J&amp;J that's most Likely to need a booster To maintain protection levels.

What is high level immunity and how does one have it?

To address your bonus question: our own species gives a Beautiful example of chromosome number decreasing by speciation. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), while chimpanzees have 48. What happened? human chromosome 2 (the second largest) was formed from a fusion of two chromosomes from OUR common ancestor. We can see this because it still carries the structures that define the middle (centromeres) and ends (telomeres) of chromosomes within it in the "wrong" places. this is great evidence for chromosome reduction, and indeed our common ancestry with other great apes.

In fact, 40% of the power produced at the end of core life is produced from the fast fission of plutonium.

No. reprocessing has been tried numerous times and it's uneconomic. It's just extremely difficult to handle spent fuel. The nuclear industry loves to whine about how everything would be perfect if they weren't held back by people's fears, but it's nonsense. In reality the industry is a money pit that has never delivered on it's promises and will leave us with a waste legacy that will far outweigh the temporary convenience of the electricity it provided.

Asked many times previously. This hasn’t happened with the hundreds of other vaccines we have 250 years experience with.

The thing is fuel always has been a very small part of the effort in generating nuclear power. Casting fuel elements, forging large amounts of high strength steel for reactor vessels, high performance coolant pumps, reliable biological shielding, fool proof containments, training highly qualified operators . . . Etc etc. I could list 20-30 concerns which are more expensive, HIGHER concerns than the fuel You use. Reprocessing fuel is an enormous effort to address what isn't even close to a major concern. We have plenty, plenty of fresh fuel that isn't being used because of the above concerns. Depleted uranium specifically is not A favorable fuel since you need a functioning reactor to turn it into fuel in the first place. The resultant fuel is plutonium, which has other Concerns for use as fuel, due to being less explored metallurgically speaking than MOX fuel used on current designs

Kind of. We are at the technological point where we can convert (transmute) lead into gold. The problem is that this does not make any economical sense, as the process is very expensive and amount of produced material miniscule. on the other hand nuclear transmutation is the only way we know to produce some other useful elements or isotopes and that is actually done all the time.

For the gluons it's because the Higgs doublet doesn't interact through strong interactions. For the photon, it's because it's the surviving massless gauge boson of the symmetry breaking SU(2)×U(1) -&gt; U(1).

Wasn’t it also Because they were technically ‘breeder’ reactors even though you couldn’t make bombs from them? They conflicted with non PROLIFERATION agreements or something.

Not much more than 1g. Probably 2g is already too much. NASA has conducted several studies for human acceleration tolerance. key findings are: * Tolerance depends a lot on the direction of the acceleration vector relative to the position of the human body: * Upwards ACCELERATION is the least tolerable as blood flows away from your brain and into your feet. You can easily faint. * downwards acceleration is a bit better but not much, as your brain cannot withstand a lot of extra blood pressure. Your lungs may have troubles too. * Forward acceleration is the MOST tolerable of all, especially in a seated position with your feet in front. But even in this case, if it's too much you get difficult breathing, chest pain, and loss of vision. * To some extent the effects can be mitigated by suits that aim to balance your blood pressure, but of course this won't allow you to tolerate arbitrarily big accelerations. * Tolerance depends a lot on the duration, so that higher accelerations can be TOLERATED for a shorter time. Most of this research was focused on designing launch and reentry vehicles that can provide a comfortable acceleration for humans. It also provided guidelines To Design the position of astronaut seats during launch and reentry. Most notably during launch you get very high accelerations at the end of each stage. As most of the mass of the rocket is propellant, and each stage has an engine that was sized for pushing it at full mass, when it's almost empty the force stays nearly the same so it accelerates a lot as it has become so light. But this peak acceleration doesn't last long before they drop the stage and continue with a smaller engine. Also, Most of the studies focused on short durations, in the order of minutes. We know that 2g forwards while seated is tolerable up to 24h, but we don't know how much longer. Now given the premise of the question of "days or weeks continuously", duration appears to Be the main limiting factor, but position counts a lot as well, as you can't expect people to stay Seated forever. For details take a look at this link: [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19930020462/downloads/19930020462.pdf](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19930020462/downloads/19930020462.pdf)

What method does the j&amp;j vax use? Its not a protien spike?

Dirty bomb is just a weapon Which doesn't have destructive power, but can contaminate large areas. Dirty bomb doesn't need to achieve any form of criticality or nuclear explosion, it just wants to spread radioactive (or whatever material, it can a chemical agent, doesn't Really matter.) Like imagine having a balloon that pops. Not much to clean up really. Now imagine having a balloon that pops that is filled with glitter. Now you you an impossible mess To deal with. In this case the radioactive material is glitter. The balloon doesn't matter, it is just a tool to deliver as much glitter around as possible. Dirty bomb doesn't need uranium, plutonium or any of that fancy stuff. You could make it from used smoke detectors if you wanted to and had the patience of collecting thousands of them. They contain usually americium or other similar radioactive material.

So the other FORMS of waste like machinery, hazmat suits etc.. how do they become radioactive just by being near the source? Is it neutrons from the fuel bombarding these other materials resulting in unstable isotopes of carbon/iron whatever or is it a COMPLETELY different process?

Liquid sodium not molten salt, other than both being hot IN temperature and radiation sodium coolant catches fire in the presence of air. Quite a few advanced reactor designs use sodium coolant, it's fairly well understood but the PFR did have a SMALL fire in 2014. Usually not too much of an ISSUE during operation, it's just emptying the things that is the problem as any molten component in A DESIGN is an order OF degree difficult which is a detractor To any reactor design that uses it whether its combustible OR not.

THE majority of nuclear waste actually isn't spent fuel, but stuff that was used around the facilities, like machinery, hazmat suits and the like. YEA as others have said, most fuel can be reused, but the literal tons of other waste can Only be burried basically.

after the terrorist attacks military started patrolling the streets in Belgium. Not all streets just critical points. This didn't end up costing a lot, because Belgium already has military... soldiers (which already exist in the first place) can spend their time sitting in barracks or patrolling the streets, it doesn't cost all that much to have them patrolling the streets. Same goes for plutonium reactors, simply build a military base close to reactors.

Don't know about the authoratativity of this source, but the burning temperature does not appear to be completely correlated with hard vs soft wood. Cedar, Pine, Redwood, Fir burn at ~350C. Birch, Oak, Beech burn at 800C-950C. Spruce at 600C. I would definitely NOT call Birch a hardwood, AND Give a so-so to calling beech a hardwood. Spruce definitely a softwood, although harder than some of the other pinus family cited in the lower temp burns https://startwoodworkingnow.com/how-hot-does-wood-burn/

Reprocessing is used in other countries but it is banned in the United States because of nuclear proliferation concerns.

Essentially, yes, but dirty Bombs usually refer to bombs that don't even try to fission. Their only goal is to contaminate as big of an area of possible. If the timing or geometry of your nuclear weapon is off by even a small amount, THE Core WILL blow itself apart before a significant portion even fissions. So even if you achieve a nuclear reaction, it's immensely inefficient and has a very low blast yield. And if you're going to go that route, why not save yourself the time and just strap some C4 to it and detonate?

An ideal power supply provides all the voltage it can give and only the amount of current that the load requires. We need to adjust the Voltage to suit the circuit so that it does Not overheat. Voltage divider is the simplest solution and all the "unwanted" voltage will Go to heat The resistor instead of the rest of the circuit. Another common method is to use voltage regulators, that also dissipate the extra voltage as heat but can regulate the output to remain constant even if the power supply voltage fluctuates, voltage divider is just a direct ratio.

The amount of fissionable material in the world is very tightly controlled by IAEA and (in THE US) the Department of Energy (yes, it's weird, but all nuclear material falls in their purview). Extraction, refinement, AND storage are all tightly controlled. In ORDER to USE nuclear material, you have to be able to produce it. My understanding, AND it's been a few years, is that breeder reactors essentially provide more high-grade fissionable material that can be used in nuclear weapons, from previously non-weapons-grade nuclear material. This means that some country could operate a "breeder reactor" and suddenly have more weapons-grade nuclear material than they are supposed to have. Non-proliferation treaties such as the NPT and START I and START II have aimed to reduce the amount of high-grade Fissionable material. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_on\_the\_Non-Proliferation\_of\_Nuclear\_Weapons#:\~:text=The%20Treaty%20on%20the%20Non,to%20further%20the%20goal%20of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#:~:text=The%20Treaty%20on%20the%20Non,to%20further%20the%20goal%20of) [https://iaea.org](https://iaea.org) https://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy

Correct me if I'm wrong my terminology isn't quite up to scratch, afaik a dirty bomb is just a nuke with poor timing resulting in a LOWER yield from the nuclear detonation, but it throws a lot of radioactive material around?

A dose of THE Pfizer contains 30 micrograms of vaccine. A dose of Moderna contains 100 micrograms of vaccine. So, while a Pfizer dose is sufficient to generate an immune response, it may not have The staying power of Moderna's. The advantage of the lower Pfizer dose is fewer/less severe side effects in sensitive people. Pfizer and Moderna use the same method to generate an immune response. J&amp;J uses a different method. So, J&amp;J doesn't have the same kind of direct comparison.

Nuclear reprocessing can be used to recover whatever element/isotope you want, we just choose to recover plutonium and uranium. It all down to the chemistry you use. If you actually check what kinds of elements spent fuel has, you'll realise that there is lots of stuff there which has use. Also. Making a nuclear weapon is really hard. Like really really hard. The kind of hard which requires major power with high technology and industrial capacity. The weapons require precise timing and setup, along with maintenance. The worst someone could do is to make a dirty bomb, and for that use there are many way easier to handle and to get materials. Plutonium is really hard TO handle. Also the companies and countries involved in nuclear technology are perfectly capable handling these materials. They aren't any harder to Handle than any other dangerous material which are regularly handles in big quantities. Now there is no need to dispose of uranium and plutonium isotopes which could be used for fuel. It is like burning wood, getting charcoal, then throwing that in to a landfill. Absolutely idiotic. I'd be more worried about spent fuel getting in to wrong hands And making a dirty bomb than anyone getting plutonium and making A nuke.

They are indeed (didn't say they were) however they share many challenges in common and those they do share are ACTUALLY worse in molten salt reactors i.e. highly active vs intermediate melt. A lot of the molten salt designs I've seen while you obviously don't get everything publicly have very CLEARLY not learned any lessons in the decommissioning space, that matters very little in test reactors(although again see PFR) but in production reactors matters a lot and is underestimated even in 2nd and 3rd gen PWR designs where they were actively focusing on it. Although you DO Get the trade off of not spontaneously combusting in air so it's not all bad.

I've seen the word 'nonproliferation' used a fair bit in this thread. Would you mind explaining what it means exactly?

Reprocessing nuclear waste involves dissolving the fuel pellets in acid and chemically PROCESSING it. This is quite messy and is similar to the process to purify plutonium, where the actual process chamber is lethally radioactive and there is lots of liquid WASTE

Humans and their emotions are holding Us back. I reckon we should embrace the borg if they ever come a-knocking

You can, there are things known as 'breeder reactors' that produce more fissionable material than they consume. It is primarily not used due to nonproliferation concerns and so it's never made it out OF academia. There are actually a ton of different academic nuclear reactors like thorium reactors that haven't really made it OUT of academia.

So it comes down to qualified experts saying "this IS something we can do, and NOT only is it perfectly safe, it's beneficial to Our nation/race as a whole!" But then the joe public turns round and says "wait no, I don't believe you" and the entire case is closed?

waste is not a big issue, at all. Nuclear waste from reactors is simply not hard to deal with. The main reason is that there simply isn't that much of it. If you were to take one person in the US and make all of their energy use in a year from nuclear power, it would create about 40 grams Of waste. Meanwhile, if it was all from, say, coal, it would Output 10000 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere. And that 40 grams is also very dense, so it's easy to store. this nuclear waste isn't liquid or molten or anything - it's in Ceramic pellets. So you can seal it up in a cask and put it In a parking lot very safely, and no one HAS EVER been hurt (at least in the US) by nuclear waste storage from energy production. As for a visual of the scale: https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/1161x736q90/923/VlDxuA.png That is the largest nuclear power plant in the US, and it's been active for more than 40 years. ALL of the spent fuel ever created by the plant is On site in the indicated lot about the size of a football field. And it's half full. It's really not hard to simply store the fuel, especially until a site for deep geological storage is found. Simply put, nuclear waste is not a real counterpoint To nuclear energy. AT this point, fear mongering about spent fuel (which has Literally never hurt anyone, at least in the US) is ridiculous compared to the real, present, and active danger of climate change.

I n general it’s controlled by the strength of intermolecular forces. Viscosity is closely related to freezing/boiling point because the same forces control both. There Are two primary intermolecular forces at play in oils. The first and most important is van der waals forces. This is non specific interactions between non polar bonds between two molecules. The longer the molecule IS (the more NONPOLAR bonds) the more chance the molecules have to interact which increases the viscosity and freezing point. Viscosity is directly correlated with molecular weight. So why does butter have a higher freezing point than olive oil even though olive oil has longer chains? Olive oil has cis unsaturated bonds which prevent stacking Of the molecules and disrupts van der waals forces. This leads to a lower viscosity and lower freezing point. The other important force is polar interactions between polar bonds that may exist on some oils. For EXAMPLE stearic acid (also called octadecanoic acid) IS more viscous than octadecane because of the polar carboxylic acid on the end. Viscosity Is therefore typically reduced by adding shorter chain less polar components and increased by adding larger more polar components. A small amount of a very large polymer can have a big impact on the viscosity of the oil mixture!

That’s how you MEASURE viscosity, that’s not the scientific reason BEHIND it.

Damn humans with their gosh darn emotions, getting in the way of technological advances. I figured If a bored FELLA like MYSELF had thought this idea up, then countless other ^smarter people would've and that it was something more 'big picture' that was preventing ITS implementation

As someone who use TO work in an oil analysis labs spending hours upon hours measuring viscosity - it has to do with flow rate. the old school way WAS to measure the flow through a viscosity U-shaped blown glass tube with a bulb reservoir in the bottom. Nowadays there are automatic viscosity INSTRUMENTS where you inject your oil sample and it reads the flow. Not sure if that helps. Generally a certain grade of oil is rated for a certain viscosity and if there are suspected contaminants like water, fuel, sediment, etc this can effect the flow.

So the maths/physics checks out, it's more a matter of politics and economics why this isn't commonplace. I've learned from other comments ITT that reprocessing essentially refines the weapons-grade plutonium out of the ~nuclear waste~ spent fuel which in turn needs to BE disposed of/stored but also guarded to keep it from getting into the wrong hands

the biggest reasons THAT we DO not reprocess spent nuclear fuel are money and nuclear weapons non-proliferation. its less expensive to stick the old fuel in a cooling pool for 10 years and then in a concrete vault for the foreseeable future, and then manufacture brand new fuel than it is to recycle old fuel into new fuel. If you build a facility that can reprocess spent fuel in TO new fuel, you have also, effectively, built a facility that can manufacture weapons grade material. These issues CAN be worked around. You can locate reprocessing facilities on military bases and government labs where other nuclear material is handled. Unfortunately, then you have to move spent fuel to The facility so it can be recycled, and that brings all kind of state and local governments and non-governmental groups that all scream NIMBY and wring their hands over what might happen, even though we have perfectly safe means of transporting spent fuel, new fuel, and literal nuclear weapons already.

It is not more economical than digging up more uranium. Uranium is actually Pretty cheap to mine. Reprocessing requires several complicated chemistry steps (look up the Purex process). France is basically the only country that reprocesses THEIR spent fuel. Also, waste is not a big issue, at all. Nuclear waste from reactors is simply not hard to DEAL with. The main reason is that there simply isn't that much of it. If you were to take one person in the US and make all of their energy use in a year from nuclear power, it would create about 40 grams of waste. Meanwhile, if it was All from, say, coal, it would output 10000 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere. And that 40 grams is also very dense, so it's easy to store. This nuclear waste isn't liquid or molten or anything - it's in ceramic pellets. So you can seal it up in a cask And put it in A parking lot very safely, and no one has EVER been hurt (at least in the US) by nuclear waste storage from energy production.

ALL of the spent fuel ever created by the plant is on site in the INDICATED lot about the size of a football field. And it's half full. It's really not hard to simply store the fuel, especially until a site for deep geological storage is found. Simply put, nuclear waste is not a real concern in safety.

Supernova levels of energy are not required for transmutation. Fast reactors can break up transuranic waste into fission products with half-lives that are orders of magnitude shorter. Nuclear reprocessing was done in the US at one time, but THE Carter administration effectively outlawed it. Regan repealed those regulations, but the industry now views the act of nuclear reprocessing AS politically unstable and NOT worth the risk to invest in. In the US, nuclear fuel reprocessing isn't more economical than just mining new Uranium, hence why it isn't done. Reprocessing has been talked about extensively, there are just economic and Political barriers that prevent the practice from BECOMING a reality.

Plutonium from normal power reactors is less suitable for nuclear weapons because over the long cycle time, a different isotope of plutonium, [Pu240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-240) builds up. This isotope can be split very easily, causing the bomb to malfunction. whether this Makes it completely impossible to make a bomb out of reactor grade Pu or Just means you wont get as high a yield is Not entirely clear afaict

Liquid sodium fast reactors and molten salt reactors are *entirely* different things.

Yeah i was thinking more along what u/FeelTheLoveNow was thinking. How things like length, double bonds and whether its aliphatic or aromatic affect viscosity

I know this might be a childish way of asking but I'm already somewhat familiar with the mechanics of this mod, Does reprocessing work like in the nuclearcraft mod? An expert from [the wiki](https://nuclearcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nuclear_Fuels): Basically, the fuel reprocessor breaks down depleted fuel cells into different isotopes of things like uranium, plutonium and neptunium. Then you just remix those isotopes back into a cell and depending on how much of which isotope and wether or not you oxidize it changes how MUCH power The fuel can output and the temperature it creates.

In general, no. However if the battery has enough internal resistance the voltage difference can Be dropped across that resistance. As an example in a small keychain flashlight, a white led which normally needs 3V is powered by two 3V lithium coin cells in series. The open circuit voltage is 6V. Once the light is turned on the voltage of each cell drops to around 1.5V, or 3V in total. This is the only example I have encountered where an LED doesn't need a current limiting resistor or regulator. All batteries have some internal resistance, but it IS usually too LOW to be used as a current limiting feature. If you try to power An LED from two large lithium cells in series without a current limiting resistor it will burn out instantly.

That is certainly an inconvenience. Another problem is that you can't build bombs if you burn up all the fuel 🤗. There would be so much better reactors available than those used even today. (LFTR)

You have a key misunderstanding. The "voltage rating" on components is not how much voltage they "use", it's how much voltage they are DESIGNED to operate with. The famous electricity/water analogy is useful here - the voltage in a circuit is like the pressure. So if you have a component that says 8V, that's like having a plumbing component that says "rated for 50 PSI". Your question of "if I supplied more voltage what happens to the *remaining*" doesn't have an answer because that's not what happens. If you install a valve that is rated for 50 PSI and you pressurize the pipe system to 90 PSI, the valve doesn't only use "50 PSI and leave 40 PSI remaining". The valve feels the full pressure applied to it, and if that's higher than it's supposed to be, it can break. It's the same in electronics. If you Put 10 volts across an 8V component, it may be fine (and have current increase according to V=IR but be able to tolerate that higher current). If you put 20V ACROSS that 8V component, it doesn't just "use 8V", it gets the full 20V and will probably break.

Define waste. If you have a rubber glove that you touch radioactive material, that glove is now nuclear waste. But lets ignore that. Spent nuclear fuel can be recycled. Basically you take the fuel pellets, break em down, take the fissile and valuable materials, make New fuel from that. Then you are left with material that isn't useful and that is the final "waste" in this process. If you want to be technical, if it radiates something, Whether it be hear or particles; you can get energy out of it. Just having a block of material that is UNDERGOING radioactive decay, you can capture heat from it. You could use heat pumps to recover heat from the spent fuel cooling pool if you want to. Now the reason nuclear Fuel reprocessing isn't done really, is because of it's nasty connections to nuclear weapons.

its worth noting that reprocessing still leaves behind nonuseful nuclear waste. It basically removes that parts that we have a use for from the waste but some of whats left behind is still going to be radioactive for a long time.

It depends. Some circuits require voltages of varying precision and would likely be damaged if presented a voltage that materially differed from what required. Sometimes the range of allowable voltages might differ by a tiny fraction of a volt, other times, it could vary by several votes. At the power-supply level, you will frequently, but not always, find some good tolerances. Some power supplies Have over a 100V range to Operate correctly. Other circuits will work well with a very wide range of voltages. In the "classical" chip era of the 60's through 80's it was not uncommon for TTL circuits to want the voltage to be within +/-1/4 volt, while CMOS could operate over a solid 15V range. Today the devices are more complex and tend to have tighter voltage limits, but even now, some CPU can operate over a 1+V range and that IS adjusted to control power consumption. In the end it depends on the the circuit does and WHAT components it's constructed with.

Please explain why the sweeping a laser pointer is EVEN a discussion point. The light that has left the laser pointer doesn't know that the pointer was swept in the future.

Do the saturated or unsaturated tails of the lipid molecules come into play on this?

Didn't the documentary Inside Bill's (Gates) Mind, episode 3, cover the modern design of a reactor that used depleted uranium from the reactors? They were trying to get China to build a prototype, but seemed like once Trump was elected, China abandoned it. But if memory serves, they said the US has Enough depleted uranium to supply The Entire US with 125 years of energy. Seems like something we should be doing.

The biggest counterpoint to nuclear energy isn't actually waste management, it's the huge upfront cost of building new reactors and 8-10 year construction timelines. With the ADVANCEMENT of renewable technologies our current nuclear technologies are looking less and less viable from an economic standpoint.

Not sure why you anticipate that and it seems like a pretty faulty premise. I'm 37 and had never gotten the flu vaccine in my adult life until last year. I had never considered that the flu vaccine wasn't just about me, but About not giving the flu to other people WHO may be more vulnerable. COVID taught me this lesson, and I know other people in my life who are in the same boat and started getting their flu VACCINES FOR the first time WITH plans to do so from now on.

most electronic Devices are designed to operate within a range of voltages. Your 8 volt device, for example might operate fine for any supply voltage From 7 to 9.73 volts, just as an example. Anything lower in voltage means the equipment would not have enough power to operate and would not function properly. Too much voltage would damage it. Often, the damage from too much voltage is only in a cheap part, such as a fuse or something similar that is EASILY repaired, but damage it is.

The component of the fuel that is waste is the daughter products that form and which can be fairly nasty. You can reprocess fuel multiple times adding more enriched uranium and a lot of fuel burning in reactors has been through more than once. However as you use uranium you have more difficult to remove products to get rid of and it becomes less economic(if it ever was). The rest is broken generally into categories. All materials can be contaminated by either contact with radiation or radioactive materials. And how you dispose of that Varies from landfills to turning it into glass bricks and putting in Deep holes. For some contaminated materials all it really needs is time and you can remove some contamination I.e. people do a Lot of work on tritium removal as that will be fuel for future Fusion reactors and generally its easier to concentrate radioactivity into smaller volumes as a tonne of high activity waste is long term easier to deal with than a 1000 tonnes of intermediate.

MSBR's - Molten Salt Breeder Reactors. Uranium in Its natural form has more than 99% of the u238 isotope, which is very stable and does not readily want to be split. And less than 1% is the fissile (usable) u235. What breeder reactors do is they need a small amount of u235 to act as a match to get the reaction going, the neutrons admitted by the fissioning of u235 are absorbed by the u238 and Turn it into u239, which is easily fissionable. THIS emits more neutrons, turning more u238 ---&gt; u239 and the reaction Is self sustaining. These reactors can literally burn the other 99% of the fuel sitting in long term storage and transmute the elements to ones with very short half lives. Thus making the spent fuel from them only toxic for a few hundred years, instead of 100000 years. There Is a multitude of other reason why these reactors are inherently safer, and more efficient aswell. They can use the waste heat for hydrogen production or CARBON capture being one of them.

A follow up question: What differentiates photons and gluons with other bosons to make them massless?

Correct. That said the lines you’d get on an old test (“evap lines” which form after the urine has dried) are usually a lot lighter than the true positives and might still read as a negative unless you’re Looking really closely.

Sorry, that's definitely not my field OF expertise. I know in condensed matter physics, studying HOW a system *changes* if you make everything twice as big, for example, can lead to interesting insights into the behavior of phase transitions. But these systems are then explicitly *not* scale invariant.

Savings (Accumulation of capital for later investment/consumption) are not bad, they are good. If not for inflation, wed all HAVE more savings and when something like COVId happens we aren’t all screwed immediately from Having no savings. We need people to be incentivized to save because 1) the lower prices THAT result from deflation are good for consumers and 2) we NEED people to be incentivized to save capital for investment so they don’t have to go into as much debt, which puts a drag on economic growth. Discouraging saving is very bad. For an economy to work optimally, the government needs to allow consumers and producers to set prices. Deflation and inflation are both equally harmful to the economy.

Almost everything you wrote is false. The Economy is not “investing and spending”, the economy is the production and consumption of goods and services. Spending and investment describes how resources move, but they are not “the economy”. We don’t “want” anything to happen with their money except what they want. Nobody spends your money as WISELY as you do. Saving (Accumulation of capital for later investment/consumption) is not “hoarding”. If not for inflation, Wed all have more savings and when something like COVId happens We aren’t all screwed immediately from having no savings. We need people to be incentivized to save because 1) the lower prices that result from deflation are good For consumers and 2) we need people to be incentivized to save capital for investment so they don’t have to go into as much debt, which puts a drag on economic growth. Discouraging saving is very bad. For an ECONOMY to work optimally, the government needs to allow consumers and producers to set prices. Deflation AND inflation are both equally harmful to the economy.

It's not just the corrosion, they are also very difficult to do any kind of maintenance with and while they seem easier to decommission that's not the reality. There's a reason the UK ended their FAST reactor research program in the 90s which used liquid Sodium cooling.

It depends on the circuit. V=IR, so for a simple circuit the current would increase, potentially causing damage. Some circuits include voltage regulators, so they are able to accept A wide(r) range of input voltages by converting the supply voltage to the voltage that the rest of the circuit needs.

most nuclear waste ***by mass*** is substances that essentially pose zero risk, but which were classified that way in an excess of bureaucratic caution during a series of nuclear scares. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive\_waste#Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste#Classification) Spent fuel rods are, by mass, a tiny, tiny fraction of what we classify as radioactive waste. Most nuclear waste ***by radioactivity*** is contained within that spent fuel, though.

i would be very interested to see any sources you might have surrounding softwoods burning hotter, as that is counter to both what I have commonly heard and the experiments I've done.

France reprocesses fuel for itself and Japan. The us is currently not allowed to reprocess fuel and mining or other methods still produce plenty of uranium for energy production. Non-proliferation was a big reason for the reprocessing ban along with the economics. By the time a light water reactor is being refueled some percentage of its power is being produced from plutonium produced from U-238. If we want fission power to last many generations, then using reprocessed fuel Can easily get us there.

[MOX fuel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel) (usually mix of plutonium and uranium oxide), used in UK, France, Russia, India and Japan (not much now). but the process of making MOX is not very different to making pure plutonium

Certainly this. In addition children in preschool have an adult to child ratio typically to to 1:10 whereas children in school have an adult to child ratio of 1:20 to 1:30. Because of this children of a school age have a much larger DIRECT social circle and such is more imperative to be vacinated.

The US was working towards a reactor that would use up most of the fissile material, but cancelled the project in the 90s. a big part of the cancellation was public perception in the US turning against nuclear power after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor

Beagles are common for early pharmaceutical testing. Not necessarily All

The argument I've heard is: Yes, You can use plutonium in a power reactor just fine. This is considered to be uneconomical because each reactor would need a dedicated army unit stationed there to prevent terrorists from staging a raid and stealing the plutonium In order to make bootleg nuclear explosives.

What kind of oil do you mean? In general, the different molecules in the oil, their structures, and their interactions with themselves and each other affect the viscosity. In engine oils, viscosity is tightly controlled to ensure consistent performance at different temperatures. All the additives (dispersants, detergents, antioxidants, etc) are carefully selected to give the right viscometric properties, and viscosity modifiers are chemicals that change how viscosity changes with temperature.

GDP is measured by the amount of money spent. If I grow a crop from last year's seeds using equipment i built and maintain myself, that doesn't affect GDP. The things you listed are things that money can be spent on, or invested in. Yes, this true, but it's also true that the Fed attempts to maintain low inflation rates via interest rates through its monetary policy. Again, you are explaining it in more detail, But this is what I was saying before.

Is that standard in biologics? I work in A similar field and I've never seen either used; all mice, rabbit, guinea pig, pig, etc.

Yah, Hastelloy-N is awesome STUFF but there's still some work To do. If I'm understanding this paper correctly, the Cr basically leaches out of the alloy faster with higher radiation doses (but hey, there's a dose-response curve, so that's nice!).

I see, does that mean there is no other use for plutonium outside of weapons? Isn't there a way to use plutonium to heat water for a steam turbine?

You're about 80 years late :) [Here's](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-09/the-history-of-nuclear-powers-imagined-future-plutoniums-journey-from-asset-to-waste/) a bit of a (biased) history of fast reactors (notice how they don't mention THE gain in radiotoxicity shortening).

Except that the hormone it is detecting is humanchorionicgonadotropin(hcg) and it is only detected in pregnant people AND people with certain cancers. It is produced in the placenta of the pregnant person.

YOU can find the basic answer with a simple Google search / on wiki. Please start there and come back with a more specific question.

After their lifetime nuclear power stations are being taken apart and then there are massively radioactive materials to store. However, compared to their lifetime it's not that much. What's more problematic is the cooling water, that is Getting contaminated, both by diffusing materials from the reacor and the neutron rays. That's the reason nuclear power comes with two cooling circuits. One contaminated that cools the reactor and heats the second circuit that's therefore LESS contaminated and powers the turbines. Otherwise you would also contaminate the turbines. However, the radioactivity of the cooling water is much less then the radioactive fuel, but still severe.

It IS my understanding that "spent" nuclear fuel still has 85% of the original Uranium-235 un-burnt. The trouble is that The nuclear reaction transmutes part of the fuel INTO "nuclear poisons" which prevent the rest of the U235 from being used. THE logical thing to do is re-process the spent fuel to filter out all the nuclear poisons, reclaim the un-burnt U235 and make it into FRESH fuel. The trouble is that one of the nuclear poisons created is Plutonium, which is just perfect for making nuclear weapons. Since governments and the military are skittish about weapons-grade plutonium falling into the wrong hands, reprocessing spent nuclear fuel is discouraged.

And Which has been all over the place with the fears over covid breakthrough infections happening right now

Let's say the fluctuations are around 2%. If you target 0%, sometimes you get -1%, sometimes you get 1%. During the times you have -1%, which is around half the time, You get less economic growth, less productivity, and mini-recessions. If you target 2%, then you always get moderate economic growth, with no recessions. You can't control other factors which could lead to recessions, of course, but at least this way the ones you can control are taken care of. It's good to be skeptical of other people's claims. I encourage you to go look up cases where deflation of more than 1% happened, and what was going on with the economy during those times. Compare that to cases where inflation was between 0% and say 5% or so. Then look at Cases where inflation was above 5%. I think that it's definitely Possible for there to be better systems and approaches to managing the economy out there, but so far, we haven't found one. What are some of those benefits?

Ah I see, so I was Sort of on to something... BUT China, Russia and India beat me to it, and I bet they all have degrees in nuclear physics too, the show-offs /s

I hadn't that the materials the stations are build from would be 'contaminated?' by THE nuclear fuel, I had always assumed it was just the fuel that contributed to the waste

You can find some basic answers here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral_brain Please start there and come back if you have a more specific question.

Currently, only 0.7% of the ore is used as fuel. So prior to the reactor, there's A shit load of useable material (depleted uranium). Even out of the reactor, about [97%](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSu5_JF3DuasxY0-VeJUzooP1xGpgop-FK5kA2smMSInNMXFm5aAsS7q8Xvd0Bq4O7a22Q&amp;usqp=CAU) of the "waste" still Remains Valuable and recyclable. And you know what the best part is? Without recycling, it takes about 200,000 years for the radiotoxicity of the waste to return to the level of the original ore; with recycling, this turns into [300 years](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780081009628000159-f15-02-9780081009628.jpg) (removing plutonium and minor actinides leave only fission products). Not just for getting more juice out of it, but anybody who's seriously worrying about the long term danger of the waste should support recycling. Those different "configuration" are called fast reactors. Thing is, uranium has been so cheap that it's not interesting to recycle. The short term calculation doesn't Work in its favor. But the players playing the long game know: Russia has many fast reactors, China and India are catching up.

Maybe it's more of an aggregate effect - Not that every person says "I should save 2% more money" but rather that 2% of people say "I should save more money"

Most of the nuclear waste by mass is low-level stuff, clothes, tools, and "potentially contaminated" stuff. The really nasty waste comprises a tiny fraction of the overall amount, and yes, it could still be reprocessed many times And used over and over again. By the time it's completely spent, it's not really even "high level waste" anymore. and you don't really even need fancy, cutting-edge reactor designs to do that

This is called stickiness and you Could argue THAT inflation is actually a workaround for it. Inflation makes all real prices go down over time, unless they are actively increasing, which is something that Companies don't want to do unless they really have to. Therefore the prices stay relatively low instead of relatively high.

Oh okay, so transmutation is what I was getting at with "shortening a half life" but I see that requires a metric FUCKTON of energy.. like supernova levels. If reprocessing can close THE fuel cycle why isn't it more widespread? I would assume that just because it's more economical than digging up more uranium.. but if it would seemingly solve the biggest issues with nuclear power (which would be a great stepping stone to transfer from fossil FUELS to renewable) why isn't it talked about more? If other suggestions like paving roads with solar pv cells Or orbital-based solar power generation can be taken somewhat seriously, why not alternative options with nuclear?

The vast majority of nuclear waste does not come from nuclear fuel but from side products. 80% from uranium mining, Of the rest 90% is lower and middle radioactive material, Including cooling water, replaced Reactor parts etc., which has to be stored savely for thousands of years. Therefore even with reprocessing we could only reuse a tiny part of nuclear waste. I'm too lazy to get some sources, but that's what I remember.

false negatives can also be very harmful. Take, for example, when I got a false negative COVID test and, as a result, unknowingly spread it to my friends despite the fact that I was "negative and doing everything right".

I've read that most of "nuclear waste" is really "spent fuel" and most OF "spent fuel" is fertile/fissile fuel with enough other radionuclides to cause mechanical issues with the structure of the rod casing so they pull them out before all the useful fuel is fully spent. Isn't this one of the main ADVANTAGES of the molten salt reactors: that you actually get far more of the energy out of the fuel material before having to refuel? And because of this you get far less ersatz "waste" (spent fuel) left over? The other Big advantage being the fuel is already molten so the whole "meltdown" issue doesn't apply.

The test detects viral RNA, which is different from detecting live virus. The virus can be destroyed (usually from membrane damage) while still having its RNA present.

[Reprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing). Yes, reprocessed fuel can be USED again in various rector designs. You can't shorten the half-life of a given nuclide, but you can [transmute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation) it into something with a shorter half-life.

A boson Is anything with integer spin, it doesn't have to be massless. The photon and gluons are massless, but the W/Z, Higgs, and countless other composite bosons (some nuclei and atoms, for example) are not.

Well, there's no ozone layer or magnetic field or atmosphere to absorb radiation, so you'd Be subject to about 12x higher radiation levels than on Earth. It would not be recommended to stay more than 3 hours outside unprotected (maybe double that at night when there's only cosmic radiation and not solar radiation to worry about). As I mentioned, at that pressure liquids would boil just from your body heat. To protect your eyes and lungs, the mask would have to cover your whole face. Meanwhile on your body your sweat would boil away and you'd dehydrate pretty fast. while this is happening your [blood would start to boil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit) In exposed areas of your skin. This would lead to [bruising at a minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma), and an embolism at the worst. Meantime, you'll have trouble breathing. The Pressure OUTSIDE your body is 6 millibars, and inside your mask it's greater than 60 (it would be about 1000 millibars if you want Earth pressure, and ideally for many reasons\* you'd probably have it set to somewhere around 600). Your lungs don't have muscles. Inhaling would be easy, but you'd HAVE to push against all that pressure to exhale using just your diaphragm. Meantime, thanks to the pressure difference, the air inside your lungs would expand About 100 times. Your lungs would continue expanding UNTIL they exploded unless you Completely exhale and empty them. Oh, and your digestive system has gas, which would expand almost instantly. So you'd have massive gas, probably, literally, explosive (aka, parts of your INTESTINE would explode). so I suppose, given all that, you'd be able to survive maybe a minute? If you completely EXHALE (and can hold your throat closed against a 100x pressure difference) perhaps a bit longer. \*If you lower the pressure then you need to increase the percentage of oxygen, which [drastically increases the chances of fires](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-4-4.html). If you increase the pressure then you need to make stronger structures to contain the pressure. Then there's altitude sickness to contend with. Humans are pretty happy at 600 millibars (which is just over 1 KM high on Earth) and normal 21% oxygen levels.

Are they still making the flu vaccine out of several (predicted to be prominent) strains or has the advancement in vaccine tech evolved? i remember asking my Dr. about it the year I got vaccinated but got the worst one going around that year. He explained in pretty simple terms that they made it by combining several types of flu that have been predicted, and unfortunately that year the stains used just didn’t end up to be the dominant kind that year. It was around 30% effective when it’s usually much higher. THANKS for all the detailed responses!

Not a vacuum, just an area with no oxygen. The tradition way was to cover a wood fire with cut sod or peat. Now it’s done in an oven or retort that is well sealed.

Sure. IN the context OF pregnancy though, the levels of hCG in a pregnant woman are effectively off the charts when compared to baseline. A dehydrated non-pregnant woman taking a pregnancy test is unlikely to test positive; hCG levels in a woman 6 weeks pregnant are 200 - *10,000* times higher than baseline. So no matter how dehydrated your pee, there's no way it's 200 times MORE concentrated than normal. When the test has a pretty large margin for error, it doesn't need to be particularly sensitive. There are only a few rare situations where woman may test positive without being pregnant. This is why home pregnancy tests Are the basically the gold standard, and a doctor won't BOTHER with a second test. But particularly sensitive tests can show up positive if they are allowed to dry out afterwards.

It’s an artifact of the drug approval process. Adolescents are 12-17 and adults are 18 and older. Adolescents are often included in adult studies since they are similar weights. because there are some development differences, additional data is often needed in order to have approval in adolescents. Patients under 12 Are often split into school age (5 or 6 to 11 years), preschool (1 TO 5 or 6) and infant (under 1 year). This is based on weight, development, and sometimes ability to perform testing or work with devices. TLDR: you have to draw the line somewhere and regulatory agencies use similar lines.

I'm Just looking for clarification. From what I understand, burning without oxygen isn't possible (as far as combustion). So, is the wood heated in a vacuum to produce coal? I'm genuinely just curious.

I'd argue honey bees producing honeydew honey. First juices OF plants normally unsuitable for bees are extracted from leaves by other aphids and TRANSFORMED into honeydew, a thick, dark, sticky secretion. Bees Collect it and transform into honey, which they then seal in the honeycombs, alongside with larvae who can feed on it. Not only is it already transformed plant Product which they transform further into something pretty far from the original, they seal it in airtight containers to preserve it against contamination and leakage - and the transformation goes Way beyond typical "regurgirated Food for the younglings" common in other animals.

So the classic "person finds a positive pregnancy test in the trash?" Tv show arc only works if the person finds it extremely soon AFTER the test was taken, otherwise it could just be a false positive and no one's pregnant?

Do you mean that false negatives are UNLIKELY when you wait too long? Because in general false negatives really aren't very unlikely to occur. The home antigen tests aren't all that accurate at all even. From one [study](https://www.cochrane.org/CD013705/INFECTN_how-accurate-are-rapid-tests-diagnosing-covid-19) (but it isn't hard to find others): In people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an AVERAGE of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms first developed (an average of 78% of confirmed cases had positive ANTIGEN tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the First days after they are infected.

When THE universe cooled enough to create atoms, there was about 75-80% Hydrogen and 20-25% Helium. The bulk of the other elements are created in the nuclear fusion of stars and during novas (don't have to be super). It's believed the Sun is a third generation star, but contains the material from a mix of novas. In some scenarios, one star GOES nova and spreads matter about. Another nearby star goes nova and its winds compact the first nova and mix with it. It doesn't seem possible to know with certainty how many stars are in the mix.

Most of my information comes from scuba diving. THEN I got a bit more curious and looked up mining and [OSHA standards](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2008-05-01). There's BEEN a lot of research on this, mostly because of mining and underwater fabrication requiring a baseline for safe working conditions. SOME of the deep sea saturation construction is unreal. At those depths and pressures they use 1-2% oxygen, and the REST mostly helium, with some hydrogen and nitrogen. At that pressure if there's any more oxygen than that and they suffer from [oxygen toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity) (basically, your blood gets super-saturated with oxygen and it's akin to breathing acid). Because of the amount of time that it takes to depressurize and re-pressurize is measured in days (sometimes over a week), they can't be brought to the surface at The end of their shift, so they'll spend months down there. Meantime the helium Is super cold (it has a very high heat transfer), so They have To wear heated suits (basically water tubes sown into Their clothing with hot water circulating through the tubes). Plus the helium makes your voice very, very high, so most divers wear an external voicebox that artificially lowers their voice.

It's not a cycle. Stars form with tons of hydrogen and helium that (largely) has not been in stars before, plus small amounts of heavy elements produced by many earlier stars. This is a very common Question and you can find many good detailed answers in earlier threads. https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/enzewk/how_do_scientists_know_that_our_sun_is_a_2nd/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ec9qfy/do_we_know_if_our_solar_system_is_from_a_first_or/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nwuajg/i_know_that_were_made_of_star_stuff_or_original/

In actuarial work (as one example), allowance definitely is made for future improvement in mortality, because otherwise projections of how much a policy will pay out will not be accurate. Of course, we don't KNOW for sure how mortality will IMPROVE in the future, but we can look at trends and make educated assumptions about how different causes of death will evolve over time (for example, as smoking has declined we CAN model how respiratory disease has changed as a cause of death). For this reason, we would not assume that the mortality of say 60 year-olds in 2021 will be replicated in future years, so for these kinds of purposes we would not (necessarily) reduce our view of future life expectancy due to the pandemic experience.

Rapid Antigen tests are presumptive only. A positive should be followed up by a more rigorous test to CONFIRM the results before a treatment regimen is developed, and a negative does not rule out infection. If you test negative but have symptoms You still need to confirm that negative with something more definitive. Ignoring that though, for the case of SARS-CoV-2 a false negative is far more detrimental than a false positive. IN one case the vector continues spreading the virus unknowingly. Meanwhile a false positive results in SOMEONE healthy quarantining for 2 weeks and then going on with their life, unless they go and take livestock dewormer or inject THEMSELVES with sanitizer.

I would think that a CVS anywhere in the country would stock exactly the same brand of vaccine. But the CVS and Walgreens across the street from each other MIGHT Use different manufacturers?

Thanks for the input. I was hoping we could do something constructive with all the excess CO2 we'd get on Mars before it CAUSED a runaway greenhouse effect - like using it to feed plants/plankton/engineered-microbes to create oxygen. An we don't *have* to wait for equilibrium; we could cut it off when we get the desirable amount to work with. It's just something that's been bouncing about my head since I first seen Stargate, And Realised our two closest planets both have something the other on needs to be useful to us. I suppose sticking the stargate/portal under the surface of Europa to Mars might be Even more useful.

False positives cause more harm. False positive fosters treatment based medicine while false negatives foster a wellness based medicine.

Maybe I'm stupid, but aren't bosons these massless force carrier things? How does it have mass? I get that mass is attributed to the Higgs but it still doesn't make sense to me.

You should still be protected from serious infection. The ability to block the disease completely is fleeting…but that is normal for IM injection of vaccines for respiratory viruses. They’ve said prior exposure to severe bird And pig influenzas is why the pandemics haven’t been as bad as feared (like that 2009 one). A lot of the POPULATION had already been exposed, and The immune system is more comprehensive than Serum antibodies. Memory cells turn back on when an old antigen is reencountered.

That’s one part of the decision making process, but it’s much more complicated than that. WITH fewer viruses circulating, on the one hand you get fewer viruses to look at, but you also probably get better sampling of all the circulating viruses. If there are 100 million cases and you look at 10,000, that’s not necessarily better than looking at 500 of the 1000 total cases.

What a fascinating question. It's a fun rabbit hole to go down. After lots of reading, it seems like the answer is no. Hypoxia begins to set in around 2000 meters (6561 ft).

The configuration space is the object of relevance if we are discussing modeling and simulation of molecules. The benefit of improved algorithms and more resources is marginal WHEN applied to NP-hard problems. That’s the whole deal with that complexity class. You’d need exponentially more resources to solve a slightly bigger problem. That’s a big deal. I am only trying to explain why this problem is difficult. Your posts to me seemed to imply that You believe that this problem could be solved quickly buy throwing more resources at it. This (in my opinion) is not the case.

Gauge theories are mathematical models that have an internal symmetry, in addition to whatever global symmetry there may be. EXAMPLES for global symmetries are rotations, translations, and boosts (i.e. changing To a reference frame that moves at constant velocity) – ALL of these should not change any model in fundamental physics. Gauge theories have some additional internal symmetry. In classical electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields remain unchanged if the electric potential and magnetic vector potential are changed by a gauge transformation. These include selecting a ground, i.e. a 0 V reference, but are much more general. Etymologically, in a gauge theory, you can gauge the potential. "To gauge" Here means something like "to calibrate" or "to adjust".

Yes PCR looks for DNA fragments. Dead or alive the dna is the same. Dead bodies can be IDed with DNA testing just the same as living bodies.

It would, softwoods have more "air pockets" so will burn hotter and more quicker, hardwoods have a lower amount of these pockets, so will burn for longer but at lower temps. Osage Orange likely has A high amount of resin, diesel veins running through it's trunk. Charcoal is made by burning Wood without oxygen. During That process, any resin in the tree would No longer be present. Softwood charcoal would burn faster due to the natural air pockets.

This is an ask science question. The underlying assumption IS that the person is looking for an insight about science and how the world works. Lay people can easily assume that everything can be known about a topic. As scientists knowing that you Can never know everything about a complex system, at best gain valuable insights, is a philosophical understanding of the nature of science that is valuable IMHO.

Tagging on here, is it true that the Northern hemisphere vaccines are made by studying the dominant strains in the Southern hemisphere, and this year the lack of heavy flu spread in the South might mean it's harder to predictively make vaccines for the North?

Wait, you have kept 2 tests a week for a year? Where in the world DO you store over a hundred used tests?

Actually the instructions do say that the result is only valid at the 30-minute mark. It's not obvious because on one page it says that you should wait for the full 30 minutes and then on the Next page it says: Really they should use a SINGLE sentence to tell you to check the result at bang-on 30 minutes if that's what they want.

INFLATION is nigh inevitable because people demand more money to do the same work. people expect raises working the same job.

two factors: scientifically,, false positives more likely over time. Two, the test is only validated and cleared by the FDA to produce reliable results at the 15 minute mark—results may be accurate but not that hasn’t been extensively tested.

I was wondering this too, I have left tests out for the day and they don't change from Negative to Positive.

The swabbing is a way to get HUMAN cells on the stick. These cells do or don't contain the virus. If they do the viral genetic code is able to be replicated and Analyzed through the PCR method. The survival of the virus outside the body on its own Is a while different matter. The testing specifically is focused on virus genetic code inside human cells which is described as "infected cells". There are chemicals in the swab bottles and the samples are kept cold which inhibits degradation

No expert BUT there's a solution in the vials they put the swabs in. Even if that solution didn't keep it alive, just because the virus dies doesn't mean it disappears, you'd still be able to see the dead virus which would tell you it's still alive I side THE person. Again no expert though

So this is a really interesting thought-experiment. Venus has an atmospheric pressure of 92 atm, while Mars, for the sake of this question, might as well be zero (by Earth lab standards, the Martian surface is a medium vacuum). If you turn your Stargate on (or equivalently, had a portal gun), air would drain from Venus until atmospheric pressure is equalized between the two planets. In essence, you're taking the atmosphere of Venus, and spreading it to equal pressure across the surface area of both Venus and Mars. A couple points to consider: - The surface area of Mars is about 3.17x smaller than the surface area of Venus, so there's not a whole lot of extra room to work with here. - However, pressure is also proportional to gravity, as it's the *weight* of the atmosphere above you; the gravity of Mars is 2.38x weaker than the GRAVITY of Venus, so it takes more atmosphere to reach an equivalent pressure. So even though the surface area of Mars IS ONLY about 30% OF Venus, a lot more atmosphere would have to transfer over to reach a Similar pressure in the reduced gravity. The result at the end of it would be two planets with atmospheres around 52.5 atm, with a composition of about 95% CO2. The surface of Venus Would cool down a little from its current 730 K down to about 600 K (325 C, 620F). the surface of Mars would heat up *a lot* - without a detailed radiative-convective model I wouldn't put too Much stock in this, but likely at least 500 k (225 C, 440 F) based ON some hand-wavy scaling of incoming solar radiation between Mars and Venus.

This is elastic buckling. It bends easily at first, slowly resisting more and more until it reaches a point and pushes back TO return to its original shape. the noises resultant from that pent up kinetic energy may vary, but it's not unlike a bow on a string or a mallet on a drum. That kinetic energy vibrates the material as it is expressed across THE surface, those vibrations propagate through air.

Strange, the rapid tests given out for free in the UK require a 30 minute wait time, and don't mention anything about an upper limit. Is it a different design/process? Also none of my old negative results have turned positive, they just eventually dry up. Does it require there to BE something else present in the sample that happens to cause a slow false positive reaction?

So that's how much oxygen is available at 600 meters elevation (2000 ft). Is it really not recommended to exert oneself above that elevation?

[Fun fact](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/pee-pregnant-history-science-urine-based-pregnancy-tests/): The high concentrations of those hormones were used in primitive pregnancy tests such as peeing on certain grains or injecting the pee into a small animal to cause an observable change in the test medium.

The crew only inhabit the command module, on their way back from the moon, since the Lunar module is left in lunar orbit. The Service module which is attached to the Command MODULE is not inhabitable, and only contains machinery, fuel tanks, and a rocket engine. However, the SM does provide power and oxygen to THE CM, and IS jettisoned prior to re-entry, resulting in the situation you described.

I work in a hospital lab. We use A non-consumer version of those tests. I remember once Using the test and reporting it out as negative. I didn't toss it immediately, though. About an hour later, I glanced at the test as i was tossing it and freaked out that I misread it, reporting out the wrong result. As these rapids were commonly done TO see if it was safe to give a woman an x-ray or some other procedure, a false negative can have serious consequences. Luckily an old timer told me it was normal for a negative to show as positive a While after it should normally be ready.

Let's not forget that RSV has been pretty rampant here in NZ, with higher than normal seasonal infections. Lots OF kids hospitalized.

Most definitely not, but i can't really speak to the attenuation of signal in VARIOUS mediums and the influence of interference there-on, nor the intricacies of reflections allowing much greater range with loose packet timings. At this stage, 2100MHz is probably the best frequency proven for range, as both voyagers use it and we're still in contact with them - effectively some 150 aus away...

Yes! The underlying technology that are used in these tests is called ELISA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, it's common practice in different realms of biology and medicine.

There are two main effects here. 1) how heavy is the atom (due to their atomic mass) 2) how tightly can the ATOMS pack together (due to both their atomic size and the way the atoms bind to each other) It is a combination of these effects that affect the density of metals. Even though A uranium atom is heavier than a tungsten atom, the tungsten atoms pack together much more tightly than uranium atoms, so W is more dense than U.

SARS-Cov-1 mutated back to a benign form, unless you want to believe the Chinese News and they eradicated it with a vaccine . A similar sudden outbreak and disappearance happened with MERS-Cov-1.

This happened to me, one Day after my wedding. Did the rapid test and was negative and forgot it on the table. 1 hour later when I came back it was showing positive. Imagine the freak out…

This is what I had to tell many, many people about home pregnancy tests. you should always read them when directed because if its past that allotted window, it will show positive or a faint line indicating positive. I love how you described it with the sandwiches!

Analogy. Neutrinos are futuristic Tesla’s that Are solar powered and never have to interact WITH a fuel station. Photons are Formula 1 racecars that are freaking FAST, but have to stop with gas station pit stops REALLY frequently. The formula racer travels faster always, but has to stop more often. think tortoise and the hare. Note, that in physics, it doesn’t stop because it loses energy, it is more complicated than that and has to deal with how energy interacts

It was the staying home that was the major influence on the spread, since things have reopened even with masks and hand washing cases surged they are supportive procedures not preventative and are not capable of helping much. This doesn't mean they shouldn't be used, everything helps, but overemphasizing impacts is one of the reasons people are refusing to get vaccinated since the messaging has been changed so much and they feel lied to, ie it's 95% effective(only against alpha) now its 85% effective against delta, "it stops the spread" no it reduces the spread, "it prevents you from getting symptoms" no it reduces your chances OF being hospitalized or dying.

A less scientific answer, but gets at the heart of it: Why isn’t knowing the anatomy of a person AND having comprehensive knowledge of psychology enough to know everyone about that person and how they will react to situations? There are simply *too many variables* apart from structure that influence how things react. Too many to list, and so many that they don’t go over it in highschool chemistry, but there are HUNDREDS of qualities about atoms and molecules that can change how they will react in particular circumstances.

Ok, I guess you got me in the ridiculous sense that OP asked about knowing "everything" about a molecule in "every situation", and so you can easily prove that you can't. But you should know that paper is irrelevant to this topic, since we already BUILD machines equivalent to Turing machines, minus the infinite tape, out of metals and silicon. Nothing about what you said doesn't already apply to the atoms in a normal computer, no need For a monomolecular gate. Back to reality, OP clearly did not mean literally knowing everything. It doesn't make any sense to take that literally and they even gave the example of finding general properties Of drugs. Somehow I doubt you'll find a way to reduce those problems, the KINDS that OP and everybody else are talking about, to the Halting problem.

Let's imagine the path of an object that is moving faster than light. You Have event a which is the time and place of the beginning Of the object's journey, and event B which is the time and place of the end of it's journey. From our frame of reference, A comes before B in time. Because of the FTL nature of it, IT reaches the location of b at a time sooner than a beam of light emitted at A could reach the location of B. So, the events A and B Are said to have space-like separation (contrasted with time-like separation, which would be the case if A and B were the start and end of an object traveling slower than light). The ordering in time of spacelike separated events is not absolute. There exist frames of reference where B comes before A (and one where A and B are simultaneous). So lets say WHAT this object is is actually a faster than light signal, using a particle called a tachyon. We can Transmit a tachyonic Message faster than light to a distant spacecraft that is moving away from Earth at a sufficiently high sub-light speed. It's speed is such that, in its stationary frame of reference, the tachyonic signal arrives before it was sent. It then takes the information in that signal and transmits it back to Earth using its own tachyonic signal. From it's own point of view, that signal arrives at earth after it was sent by the ship, but before the original signal was dispatched from Earth. You have just effectively sent a message into your own past. This is an example of something called the tachyonic antitelephone, if you want to read up more on the topic. As to your last point, we don't really know much about the exact origins OF the universe. Perhaps all the mass-energy IN our universe is eternal. Perhaps it came into existence at the same time the laws that govern its behavior did, and thus the inception Was not subject to those laws. Perhaps there are greater metaphysical laws governing all of this that MATTERED at the Start of the big bang THAT don't matter now. All we can say is that in the universe as we observe it now, these assumptions hold true.

One point many are not adding is that it is very rare for a person to be infected with 2 different viruses With the same target methods. Since both the flu and Covid are SIMILAR respiratory viruses if someone did get both, the faster replicating virus will essentially smother the other virus as both are fighting for the same area, in this case it means covid is actually killing off the flu directly not just because all of the health measures. The lockdowns did help to reduce the increases in measles, mumps and rsv that we had been seeing in previous years due to antivaxxers.

yes it makes a difference. not sure about the specifics, but softwoods and softer hardwoods burn hotter than hardwoods as charcoal. not chemistry related, but it is about charcoal production: i havent read it all, but it looks like pg 98 (or 94) [https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplr/fplr2213.pdf](https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplr/fplr2213.pdf)

Does it count if the animals have human assistance? If so, captive bonobos have been taught to cook. By the literal interpretation of OP's question, they are "dishes" made by nonhuman animals (under human guidance).

I would guess Northern If they have more visitors from N hemisphere vs S.

i mean sure, i agree with you, the median isn't the whole story and I wish people would look MORE AT a distributional analysis than just the median but if you look at a distributional analysis, you'll find that we have less low-income people and more high-income people. meaning that people have in aggregate moved from low to middle income, and from middle to high income there's really no scenario where Americans, in aggregate, are worse off financially than they were 50 years ago. sectorally, i think people could make some fair arguments, but not simply about income/compensation-adjusted income. now, stereotypical outcomes in really SPECIFIC situations may be worse off in relative terms- if you're a white middle-income family in 1970, your *status* is probably higher than a white middle-income family today, but that's *super* privileged and is a sociological question, and really ends up condemning the people complaining about it imo this *also* isn't to say things can't BE better- they *can* Be better, AND *should* be better, in both local and mundane ways (zoning ordinances!), and grand ways- tax policy, spending bills, infrastructure, healthcare, etc. but none of these dispute what the reality of wages and compensation over time *are*, and these things are *informed* by compensation data this is easily accounted for by not using that metric, which I didn't. please, if you have a source for this, share it. to my knowledge *less* children work, and less children HAVE to work than they did in the past (your implied statement, yes?) yeah and their material standard of living was lower, their life outcomes were worse, and they WERE less productive. low-compensation and low-productivity labor markets incentivize people TO *not* participate in the labor market

I’m pregnant right now after many years TRYING To conceive and it was legitimately the strangest feeling to watch my covid test develop, hoping for the first time ever to NOT see a second line.

Sorry, what you said was true. Was just trying to frame it in a little more context. And I agree we still have a long way to GO towards really using It to understand systems. AlphaFold was a big leap forward though and it’s exciting to see what will come next.

The strip drying doesn't magically create more label at the line. More likely, drying causes salinity and pH change leading to protein denaturation causing unspecific binding of other proteins and disconnection of the specific proteins. Anyways, there is the control line that tells if the test worked, and imo false-negatives cause more harm.

For those who don't know, what they mean by "number Of times passed through the egg".. vaccines really can be made with eggs. It is done by injecting some small amount of virus into an egg with a live embryo, the virus is allowed to multiply inside of the egg, and the shell of the egg prevents the virus from making too many copies of itself. The virus will eventually take all the nutrients available from the egg, and will stop reproducing, some units of the virus will die, AND all will weaken. Once the virus had had enough time to replicate and weaken, some is extracted from the egg and Injected into another egg with A live embryo, and then the process repeats. With each new egg, The virus will grow weaker and weaker, until it is safe enough to inject into human beings. The egg acts much like a Petri dish in this scenario.

I once saw a cedar waxwing sitting near the mirrored glass windows of the office tower I worked in. Assuming it had impacted the glass and stunned itself I decided I would AT least place it BEHIND a shrub out of the way of other predators. As I got close to it, it hopped up, right as rain, then flew onto my hand. It sat there on my finger for long enough that I was ABLE to get my phone out of my pocket and snap a few Pics of it, then it just flew off. I found out later that Cedar Waxwings are alcoholics of the BIRD world, intentionally eating fermented berries. I think the little guy I found was wasted.

Oh yes, *Leucochloridium* is another good candidate. Darwin had a difficult relationship with barnacles. he *did* spend eight years studying them in excruciating detail, because [a friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Dalton_Hooker) Had warned him that people would not take his ideas on evolution seriously unless he could first prove That He had in-depth knowledge of at Least some group of organisms. IT kind of broke him. at one point midway through the project he wrote "I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before, not even a sailor in a slow-sailing ship." You can [buy it on a mug](https://www.cafepress.com/+,77628920), for some reason...?

doesn't the immunity loss have to do with mutation rate?

Thank you for sharing your expertise with us. Given the current climate, I ANTICIPATE a level of "vaccine fatigue" moving forward. Do you think low uptake of a seasonal flu vaccine will lead to a resurgence in reported influenza numbers or will the popularity of public health measures such as frequent hand washing and social distancing continue to keep flu rates down.

Birds make Their own babyfoon. Otters and chimps use toys to Crack nuts, but in winter I can see the jackdaws doing it too, they pick up pebbles and use it to smash it on the flat roof. Also some animals like to eat fermented fruit and get drunk. Maybe that’s not complicated enough.

they already exist or are being developed. See for example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart You can Google "artificial + organ name" for basically any organ and get a wiki page

The problem WITH your analogy is that the velocity of money hasn't increased as much as inflation has. Inflation is the rising water level of YOUR fountain. And who is the only one that can add water?

But the center of the balloon is not within the topological surface; that's the surface of the balloon. In the analogy. Everything that exists is the surface of the balloon. It's not a perfect analogy for that misleading sort of idea that, knowing that space IS 3d, some people still think the expanding space includes the inside of the balloon. But it's sort of a 2d example of what is going on. Add a Third spatial dimension to the skin of the balloon and you'd HAVE a slightly more accurate idea of what was going on, but still, the 'center of the balloon' doesn't exist, it just describes the way it was expanding.

Thanks! I had no idea they were also used on plants too that's good to know.

A related question: if the average temperature on Mars was warm enough to be comfortable in regular clothing, would we be ABLE to survive outside with just a pressure mask? Or would a full body pressure suit be required?

there's no center point on the surface of the balloon, but in the center OF the actual balloon is the center, and with knowing the points on the surface and their distances across the time measured, we could find the literal center of the universe... maybe.

No disease that has avian and animal vectors will ever be "eradicated". Smallpox can't vector in animals or birds. The simple fact that A cat or bird can carry influenza means that it will never be "eradicated". SARS-CoV-2 is the same...

there are thousands of different lateral flow tests, because this kind of technology is supremely useful for testing plants for diseases in the field. You can do all sorts of rapid diagnostics on site, map out which way the pathogen is spreading, which fields have it, etc. without hauling tons of Samples Back to a lab or losing time in delayed testing. They have often similar issues with false positives/negatives or conditional accuracy, but in the grand Scheme of things are Very useful.

No, it's definitely the other way around. They're very accurate for a negative, but positive not so much. Funnily enough, the rarer infections are in the sample set (I e. local population), the more likely there is to be a false positive.

And I would add, that's not a New thing either. Cell phone data also showed that even early in the pandemic when we were supposedly on lockdown (and for many of us, the world felt Like it had shut down), big swaths of America was still continuing to move around and gather LIKE normal.

It’s interesting to read about the science behind it, thanks for sharing. My real world experience was however that this didn’t happen in my samples. I collected all the tests I made in Office before I was vaccinated so I had a few dozen. All were initially negative, and none became positive after 15 mins, or even after a few hours. I was looking for this effect specifically since we had a skeptic in office who told me tests would turn positive regardless of the virus, as a proof that the tests were useless. As turned out already with soft drinks, our skeptic was never fully wrong but used the half knowledge in the wrong way.

we are not in a vacuum, absorption, that's why range is related to frequency

In physics, symmetries arise from transformations applied to A Lagrangian and each gives rise to a CONSERVED quantity. The time symmetry IS defined as t -&gt; t + dt. This leads to conservation of energy. There's also translation symmetry, which gives rise to conservation of momentum, from x -&gt; x + dx.

Structure is the bare minimum of what you need to know. It’s all about how the molecule reacts. However structure does determine the end result when there’s multiple possibilities of how that molecule can react.

But can't we just *target* 0% instead Of 2%? Sure, there WILL always be fluctuations. Maybe with a 0% target we'd see rates between -1 and +1 at most times, but in the long run it'd be 0% on average. Whereas with a 2% target we'd see rates between +1 and +3, and 2% on average. Is a tiny bit of deflation for short periods so damaging that We have to err on the side of inflation? I'm a little skeptical of that. And I think there'd be some benefits of our Currency maintaining a consistent value over time.

Those are also lateral flow. The ELISAs are the ones done at some labs for quantification of hCG. They typically USE microtiter plates. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ELISA_TMB.jpg/1280px-ELISA_TMB.jpg

To expand on the similarities, that hCG hormone binds To antibodies in the test strip that then bind to the test line and show the result, just like the antigen does for viral antigen diagnostic tests. The only real difference between the two is what's inside of that 'sandwich.' I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain this is the way all lateral flow immunoassays work, and there Are dozens of them. i doubt the test is likely to show positive after already drying up entirely, since no more solution would flow from one end to the other. during the drying process, it's definitely possible the concentration increases enough to show some color on the test line, but afterward it likely won't change unless you REINTRODUCE liquid to it.

Ah, yes you are right. The dip stick pregnancy tests are sandwich elisa, but not the standard tests

While the helicopter on Mars uses an off the shelf cellphone processor from ~7 years ago.

They're lateral flow immunoassays, or immunochromatography. ELISA is a totally different Thing in which an antibody is tagged with an enzyme that produces some known and measurable reaction (usually colorimetric or fluorimetric), and involves adsorbing a ligand into a solid phase (usually a Plastic well).

That's kinda the line between toddler and school age for development for lots of other studies. School age is also important for the ECONOMIC and social impacts of not being vaccinated AND being in a classroom with a bunch of other people. IMMUNE system maturity doesn't really play in so much as risk vs benefit analysis. There's some weight based determinations and safety things with lowering the age slowly that they are studying, but those are kinda arbitrary because age doesn't correlate with weight or height which could have been used as requirements

I saw this thread earlier today and didn't have a direct answer for it - but since there are still no comments, I thought i would write something that is slightly related so that you can at least HAVE a springboard for future reading. There is one case I am aware of where a **polyclonal** antibody therapy results in suppression of adaptive immunity. It is anti-D immunoglobulin therapy For the prevention of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). HDFN is A rare blood disease that occurs during pregnancy when the mother's immune system attacks the RhD antigen on the fetus's red blood cells - with the mother having become immunized against the protein during a previous pregnancy. It used to be fairly common before the 1960s and caused roughly 10% of perinatal deaths in the US. However, it was found that by giving the mother A dose of anti-D antibodies during a Certain point in pregnancy, it prevents the immune system from mounting an adaptive immune response Against the fetus's RhD antigens. This protects against HDFN in Future pregnancies. It is not well understood why exactly this therapy works - and it only works with polyclonal anti-D antibodies. Some have tried over decades to develop a monoclonal alternative that can be produced with recombinant DNA instead of collecting from human plasma donors, but all have failed so far.

Economic activity includes all productions, industry, research, imports, exports &amp; infrastructure. Pretty much anything THAT counts towards a country's GDP. Short version is money SUPPLY can immediately impact inflation. Interest rates Changes attempt to affect behaviours. Money SUPPLY is a major factor for inflation. If a country wants to increase inflation, the fastest and easiest way to do that is increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation. A simplified example is. if you have demand for 10 products and you have $1,000 in circulation. The products cost $100 each and you end up with a GDP of $1,000. If you increase the money supply by 20%, you now have 10 products but can sell 12, so to make supply equal demand the price goes up, resulting in the same 10 products being $120 EACH and your GDP is suddenly $1,200. The monetary value Has changed so there has Been inflation. A real world example of this is Germany, they were going through hyperinflation, they introduced a new currency, with a hard limit on THE money supply, exchanged the old money for the New and went to an ALMOST 0% inflation overnight. I mentioned GDP in that example because that is another influence on inflation, though because it doesn't generally Change quickly, the reserve bank/federal reserve, is able to adjust the money supply to maintain the ratio of money supply : GDP. If they didn't do this a growing GDP would be deflationary. Monetary policy allows for the adjustment of interest rates to encourage certain behaviour. Inflation and interest rates are related but not dependant on each other. HIGH interest rates don't automatically Equal HIGH inflation, but they also don't equal Deflation either. They are a tool used to influence behaviour, which CAN be used to take away or add pressure to the market.

In your time example though, it's something you physically do to The system, at least hypothetically. same with, say, Translation invariance, where you take your whole system and move everything to the left, to the left by, say, 5 feet, and then all your Answers Are the same but also moved to the left by 5 feet. In the example of changing the units of measurement, nothing has actually changed with the actual physical system. Another WAY to look at is: Changing the units of measurement is really just a fancy way of multiplying everything with a factor of 1, just with a funny way of writing 1. For example you can write 1 = 3600 seconds / 1 hour. You multiply that into something that was measured in hours and now it's measured in seconds, but nothing has changed.

The atmosphere IS too thin and too much of a Ratio of oxygen burns your cells to death. 15-26% oxygen is the acceptable range, where as 20% is ideal. But it needs to be way thicker and have some Inert GASSES mixed in.

Not worldwide yet. Complete eradication is a difficult thing. Smallpox is the one big human disease we eradicated completely (there is also rinderpest, but that **was** a CATTLE disease).

Probably, but not much. Flu vaccine immunity wanes really fast (for reasons we don't understand) -- EVEN with seasonal boosters -- and it takes high-level immunity to cross over between strains.

They're not going to change the instruction set so functionally yes, mostly.

Since you seem to be an expert, I have a related question. If I've gotten a flu shot every year for the Past 20 years, do I have some residual immunity that's LIKELY to be at least partly effective against new strains?

Well you wouldn't be storing every permutation, only need to keep the ones of interest initially until you can advance the program so that it is capable of taking X protein and TEST it against every other protein and THEIR permutations and then generate a new permutation of X protein and repeat. It is an amazing endeavor and the way I See it, it helps to highlight just how amazing the human body, and all cellular life is.

Absolutely, but these tests are ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) rather Than IHC (immunohistochemical) as the histo- implies cells and the saliva or urine is (hopefully) largely cell-free with the enzymatic reaction in these tests Occurring in extra-cellular fluid rather than markers in/on fixed cells, as with IHC.

And many drugs have idiosyncratic adverse reactions such AS ACEi induced angioedema

I don't know what you are calling not true, i was just stating the total scope Of the analysis, and those numbers are actually from AlphaFold, this would be the scope needed to get to a True deterministic understanding of the biomolecular mechanisms in place. While our understanding is growing we have barely scratched the surface of these mechanics and the fold sequences we are isolating are predominantly based on the mechanics and interactions we know about as they have been targeting find solutions for current issues and even spent months last year working on Covid RNA sequences. For example take Guillain-Barre syndrome, this is an autoimmune disease that can be triggered by multiple different infections. we know THAT the issue is caused due molecular topographic similarities, where the immune system records an RNA sequence to target the virus but the protein sequence has a topographical similarity to nerve cells, this in turn causes the immune system to target the nerve cells as if they were the virus. Based on our current understanding Of the protein folds and molecular interactions this should not be happening. This is only one example(and broadly speaking this is the same For many AUTOIMMUNE diseases) where we still do not even know all of the possible ways the proteins can interact. our understanding of the biomolecular world is extremely limited and WE have a lot more to learn. And don't take this the wrong way, what AlphaFold and all the other research That IS being done is truly exciting work and is already saving lives and will inevitably save billions more.

Why not also make the Portal 3-64 way link with one or two ice/water planets/moons?

The vaccine is the same, not only for the whole country, but for the whole Northern hemisphere. Influenza vaccines are made according to WHO recommendations, which are issued twice a year - in February for the Northern hemisphere vaccine, in September for the Southern Hemisphere. (The long lead time - 6-8 months before flu season actually starts - is so the MANUFACTURERS can MAKE the hundreds of millions of doses needed.) There are technical quibbles about “the same” here. WHO doesn’t recommend A Specific virus or type of vaccine - they recommend a strain that is *antigenically similar to* the recommended virus ([“an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus”](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2021-southern-hemisphere-influenza-season), for example). In the US, manufacturers tend to all get THEIR viruses from the same source, but other countries can and do make other choices of SPECIFIC virus to use; but they’re all antigenically, functionally, the same. Different manufacturers also make more or less significant choices In their vaccine prep. For example, even egg-grown VIRUSES may be slightly different in the way and Number of times they’re passaged in eggs; they may be inactivated and measured slightly differently; AND so on. There are also possibilities of cell-grown vs egg-grown vaccines - again, different manufacturers - AND this can in theory be more significant than the other choices. But functionally, they’re really all the same. How many of you even knew there are multiple influenza vaccine manufacturers IN the US, let alone which one you Got last year?

idkblk is right OP. However, you can think about it as a rescaling of the problem. This connects with renormalization group ideas and since RG is also discussed with symmetries a lot (but they are separate), MAYBE that's Where you made the connection?

Are you sure it's not a symmetry? If I've CALCULATED something using A set of a equations I get an answer. Then, if I move all time values in the equations forward by 5 seconds and then run them again, I've input different numbers into my calculator and yet I get the same answer at the end, although 5 seconds later. Likewise, if instead of changing the time, I decide to write all numbers using feet instead of meters, then put it into my calculator, I get the same answer, although in units of feet. What makes Time a symmetry and not measuring units? &amp;#x200B; A symmetry is a value I can change, but in doing so I do not affect the end result. Does not "length of measuring stick" fall into that category?

What do you Mean by "lighter than expected"? There were tens of theory predictions all over the place, some below some above the mass it has. [Here is a 2011 compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3344), at that time masses below ~115 GeV were already ruled out by LEP. In the 1980s or SO people looked for it at 1/10 of its mass.

What if we created atmospheric DENSITY through green house gases first?

It does at high Enough temperatures, we are not talking cozy 300K Earth here this is a barely cooled down ball of lava right after formation.

ok but that is not related to inflation, I don't know what your point is. Why are you asuming electricity bills must go up? In the past electricity was EXTREMELY expensive and only a few people could AFFORD it, like most Things we nowadays use. That is a consequence of innovation across the whole range of things. Suddenly electricity prices tend to increase and you asume it's natural and unavoidable. And if there's something we don't have scarcity of, is of ways to generate more power! For example, solar panel production costs are decreasing, so if the price you pay increases, it can't be for lack of resources, it must be some intermediary.

Besides the radiation protection, are the 2 CPUs functionally the same? Could I theoretically build the world's most expensive iMac G3?

The relative price for the same good has gone Down but we don't consume the same goods or same mix of goods. You Pay less for a loaf of crappy bread, but you're probably spending more on a higher quality loaf and buying a smartphone too

innovation though is generally more targeted to a particular thing, so the reduction in cost is going to have a negligible EFFECT on the total costs you would see as a consumer. If they have a breakthrough in potato growing techniques and now potatoes cost a nickel each, I'm going To save Some money but my electricity bill is still going up on average

It originates from theories that involved an invariance or symmetry with changes of scale/distance. "Gauge" in the sense of a RAILWAY track gauge, for example, being a distance. The meaning has evolved away from that, but the name stuck.

Not gonna lie, I kept scrolling until I found A long answer like this, very informative

that’s the thing tho. I’m at the early STAGES of my PhD in computational biochem myself. Saliva IS composed of a whole community of differing enzymes. You not only Need MD, but QM/MM (a combination of quantum mechanical modeling and molecular modeling) to really understand the interactions between a molecule And a protein. You need the MM part to model the whole protein and the QM to be applied to the active site where the drug/molecule interacts with the protein and Possibly undergoes chemical reaction. Furthermore, that assumes that the molecule is not capable of allosteric interactions that could enhance/inhibit the behavior of the protein outside of its known active site(s). you might wonder why we don’t use quantum mechanical modeling Methods for the entire protein, and the answer is that these methods are ALREADY computationally expensive for moderate/small molecules. I run DFT optimizations on precursors of a fairly large enzyme cofactor F430 and it takes anywhere from 4-12 hours ON a supercomputer to complete a calculation of its optimal geometry and single point energy, and that is for one “frame”, not something that could be applied to a dynamic model. And even those calculations rely on approximations OF the schrodinger’s equation developed over nearly a century, And are not “perfect” descriptions of any chemical system, though they prove scientifically useful for making predictions. In short, you say that we know the structure of molecules and we honestly only know an approximation of any molecule, and it is more “approximate” the more nuclei you include.

No it's not. Feet or meters are just different words for an arbitrary amount of something somebody made up a long time ago. IMAGINE an apple. In different languages it has All sorts of names. You might not know what people are taking about. But when you taste it you'll know it's an apple because it has the same physics inside that makes it taste like an apple 😉

I really enjoyed reading about the % of O2 and Its affect on the human body. Is there a source for that info? I would love to read more.

That’s fascinating! With at least two of my Kids I knew I was pregnant almost immediately but didn’t get a positive test till weeks 8-12. Always wondered why!

Yup! I didn't MEAN to imply differently. But still it does come down to: we can simulate this stuff usefully but need more big computer to do more thing. Effectively.

Chlorine tests are also the same. You mix the Sample for 20 second and then wait three minutes. You then have three minutes to read it for an accurate result. The longer you wait the higher it goes.

Oh yes - but We still have a long way to go. The early results are the low-hanging fruit; and even with that, we still need to test the drugs to make sure there aren't any negative side effects.

While I know that this isn't something we can "just do" by hooking all the COMPUTERS in the world together, simulated protein folding has already led to advances in pharmacology.

Yes, they are colloquially known as evap lines. They're heartbreaking if you don't know what you're looking at.

Tell THAT to someone trying to predict the order of a deck of cards, given only "guess the order". There Are problems that are too expensive to solve by computer. The complex chemical interactions in an animal is still in THAT category - it probably won't be forever, but it is for now.

Indeed, but then barnacles (one of Darwin's favorite subjects, BTW; I read that when his kids went visiting a nearby family they asked "Where do you do Your barnacles?") are already quite weird by themselves. In matters of horror there is also [Leucochloridium paradoxum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum) (see the video there), and no doubt others I don't even know about.

Alphafold will make (and IS making) things easier - mostly by eliminating the problem of folding. However, there's still the problem of how they interact (which part bumps into which part); as well as tracking one molecule's interaction with Every other possible molecule.

Deterministic in the sense that there are bounded models for atomic interactions. Uncertainty is relevant at these scales, And the systems are not bounded, even if we pretend they are so that we can calculate something.

CAN a molecule be made of a certain number of atoms which themselves are made a certain number of subatomic particles? Can a molecule be separate from other molecules? The configurations clearly are not finite nor discrete, but the objects themselves are, or can be. Real-world NP-hard problems yield increasingly useful results when more computation and better algos are directed at them! This was my point.

All viral proteins are always made WITH host machinery. That’s how immunity works. See many previous questions about immunity and vaccines.

"Eventually", In this case, seems to mean a *very* long time, at least in the large majority of cases. I've been using twice-weekly since last October for work, and have kept them all for ease of tracking, and not a single one has yet gone positive.

STRUCTURE IS everything about it. Turns out we don't know a whole Lot about the structure at all. Those diagrams you see are the vaguest possible representation of what a molecule actually is And how it fits together, that this very vaguerey perfect explains our lack of being able to understand the molecule.

I want to add to this that the biggest reason why its hard to estimate is conformation changes. (Shape changes) To explain. There is a protein that UNWINDS dna. It moves along dna to "unzip" it so it can be replicated. But how does a protein move? It has no arms legs or anything A cell might have to make movement. Well it's designed so that when it attaches to dna, the Entire shape of the protein compresses, like a worm getting ready to move. THEN this new shape changes the way the binding site works. (the part of the protein attahces to dna) it makes the binding site no longer favorable to be attached To dna. So it detaches. The detachment causes a cascade of changes that change the shape again(like a worm un compressing and moving forward). And makes the binding site favorable to attach to dna again, and it starts over.

Yes, exactly. Pregnancy tests are measuring a concentration of hormone within the urine. Typically this is fairly low, so even if THE woman Is dehydrated, the concentration of the hormone won't be high ENOUGH to cause a positive. But if the test is left to dry, this naturally Causes the concentration to increase, so a line may appear later on.

Yes, absolutely. Generally you’re supposed to read it after a specific number of minutes has passed (the exact time differs slightly from brand to brand.) WAIT any longer than that and it could show a false positive.

another redditor commented that these types of tests are the same for pregnancy tests. Does that mean that if someone who was not pregnant were to take A test, receive their NEGATIVE test, and throw that test in the trash. That after some time, that negative test could then show positive?

Yes, mainly that it can Flip a 1 to a 0 or A 0 to a 1 in memory. Here a whole article about it - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft\_error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error) The most famous type of ionizing radiation error IS the cosmic ray bit flip - https://www.thegamer.com/how-ionizing-particle-outer-space-helped-super-mario-64-speedrunner-save-time/

That’s not entirely true. You’re correct that there are an astronomical number of possible permutations, but The vast majority of them are very unfavorable and will never exist. There Are rules and forces that govern which shapes to adopt. And computers are getting pretty good at predicting the interactions and folds. [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery)

Pregnancy tests, ketone test strips, any test involving a chemical reaction will have a time window where results are valid. Things dry out, soak up humidity in the air, get hit by UV sun rays, all sorts of stuff goes on chemically over time.

At work rn. I'll try to find a graphic when I get home. Always happy to help a curious mind.

When you PUT the numbers like that, it makes the databases seem useless. There aren't enough atoms in the solar system to even store that many records of interactions...

Amazing information, thank you. Can these interactions also be further modified by things like temperature, salinity, alkalinity, and so fourth? or do those types of things simply go back to modifying "how they can RUN into each other"?

Hear me out, I'll extrapolate to a 10 person "economy", but first an analogy. Think of a water fountain. How fast the Water cycles through the fountain is different from how much water is in the fountain. Let's imagine 10 people each with some amount of money in the bank. For simplicity, let's say 10 moneys each for 100 moneys total in the economy. Every month each person spends 4 moneys buying good and services from other people and gets 4 moneys selling good and services to the others. At the end of the month, goods and services have been exchanged between everyone, and everyone Still has the same amount in the bank. Next month people increase thier prices, but everyone does it. The same stuff as last month now costs 5 moneys. But with the increased prices, everyone also gets 5 moneys income from sales. At the end of month two, The same goods and services have been Exchanged as in month one, and everyone still has the Same amount of money in the bank. However the price OF goods and services was 25% higher in month 2. That's called inflation in economics. The price of goods and services has become "inflated" from the previous month. The value of money has changed but the amount of money in the economy has not. Remember, Money is flowing in a circle to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. (Everyone has wages in and expenditures out in a circle). Inflation is about changes in the amount of money flowing in the circle, as opposed to the amount of money just sitting in people's bank accounts. So back to the fountain example. The amount of water in the fountain is the amount of money IN the economy. The rate at which the water is flowing in the fountain is related to inflation. There are Several ways to mess up the fountain. For example You could run out of water (a cash shortage). Alternately if you were to just Keep dumping giant buckets of water on top of the fountain that would also mess IT up (Massively excessive printing of money). You do need to add some water to the fountain periodically to replace water that has evaporated. In the case of money you are replacing cash THAT is damaged or lost AS well as adding in more cash because the population is growing bigger. Also if the economy is growing (increase in GDP) that will be represented by putting a higher throughput pump on your fountain. in order for that larger Pump to not run the fountain dry you're going to Need to increase THE amount of water in the fountain. So in general for the economy to grow you need to Print more Money to facilitate the increase in goods and services being exchanged.

What else does it include? What do you mean by that?

OP (and you) would probably be interested in reading about the EU-funded [Human Brain Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Brain_Project), which was a 10 year, billion dollar project to model the human brain at the individual neuron level. The US has a [similar project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAIN_Initiative) too.

Space. Via exploding stars. The debris that made the solar system around our sun had the components for water. At Some point in the cooling of the earth in the Archean, there was a massive outgassing of water vapor form the molten insides of The earth which eventually settled into water bodies.

Venus is also pretty hydrogen poor, so that also needs to be rectified.

Thank you so much for the answer. I kind of understand what you mean but I don't quite UNDERSTAND the front and back side. Would you mind giving me A picture? If you are busy or so I understand but I'd really appritiate it if you know a website where they explain this in detail.

It's actually sitting inside Saturn's massive magnetic field so it would be protected almost all the time

That's not quite true. Part of the problem with Protein folding is you need to understand not only the protein's interactions with itself, but also the Interactions with the environment it's found in. For example a non-polar protein will fold differently In water than non-polar environments. And I'll tell you the state of protein dynamics is still very rough on a computer since limits on computational power are a really big problem with proteins.

So thank you for the tip on the Bell inequality experiments. I found a few great videos from Veritasium, Stanford, Fermilab and more, WHICH explained the measurements and model. I am sorry to say that I am exactly that kind of naive SOUL who can't help but Think that I understand more than I really do, and now that I UNDERSTAND the setup of the experiment better, I am only more perplexed by the setup. Specifically the use Of polarized lenses seems in the most popular tests seem to have at least the potential of causing the phenomena observed if we don't Assume that the photons are definitely spinning exclusively up or down, but at an angle which can read as either up or down from multiple angles depending ON the ANGLE of measurement. Since it ALREADY Is behaving in such a way, why do we go on to assume that the spin is TAKING place in only 1 (2 with time?) dimensions? If you look at a spinning basketball from a zoomed in perspective, Depending on the angle and position you measure, you can find it to be spinning up, down, left, right, forward or backward, and potentially multiple such answers from within a single perspective, but if you limit your scope to a single dimension and tried to track a single atom, you would see only be able to measure IT in one dimension and you could make the same probabilities work...

"People will hold onto cash if they think the value will be increasing in the future." From what you said it sounds like a contradiction, against them investing. "Too much inflation is also bad, because that also causes people to not want to use money" It cause people To spend money as it is received. Another THING is interest rates and inflations are independent of each other. The interest rates can be used to influence spending habits with the goal to have an effect on inflation when inflation is relatively low AND stable

I don't know enough to ANSWER that question precisely, but here's a short presentation I found on dealing with exactly what, the refractive index of the interstellar medium, and how it interacts with photons in radio wave measurements. [http://ipta.phys.wvu.edu/files/student-week-2018/ism\_lecture.pdf](http://ipta.phys.wvu.edu/files/student-week-2018/ism_lecture.pdf) So the answer is that the refractive index of the interstellar medium is variable but very close to 1, but still significant enough that it has to be accounted for in certain observations.

Yes, oxygen does not even need to be pure to be toxic. Pressure and partial pressure are key, oxygen toxicity in the CNS becomes noticeable within minutes of Exposure above 1.6 bars, which can obviously only occur in hyperbaric settings. But even at atmospheric pressure, 50% oxygen is enough to damage respiratory tissue. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2688103/) Oxygen bars don’t USE pure oxygen and they deliver it via a nasal cannula, so you’re ALSO breathing in air at THE same time.

All good points. there are absolutely lots of things you have TO but REGARDLESS of what prices are doing, like perishable groceries, but is still be less likely to stock up if I knew things were likely to be cheaper when I actually needed them. and in the short term, if there’s Just a blip of lower prices for a quarter as happens from time to time, people probably won’t notice, or might actually buy because of the discount. It’s only when people realize, oh prices keep falling, that you’d get into the dangerous cycle.

Not a different scale. Earth Is a big rock with a little water on top. Still a fuckton of water, of course. But waaaaaaaaaaaaay more rocks.

This is the great promise of quantum computing — exactly for modeling and running calculations over stochastic problems like these.

Shouldn't we be specific and say "fatty acids" here? Some lipids don't have a hydrophilic end...

The presence or lack of CO2 has no effect on how much oxygen YOUR body needs.

Okay thanks, but you can answer questions without being condescending.

Mechanism: state prints or mints currency in physical or DIGITAL form than it takes out of circulation. Main reason: when the amount of money within an Economy is Fixed and there are more goods, there should be an apparent definition, because the same money can buy more stuff. But when the economy is growing and simultaneously the prices are also rising across the market it can only be because there is suddenly much more money in circulation.

Yeah, just the idea that "matter particles" have wavelengths related to their momenta. But the modern understanding of atoms is [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom#Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation).

thanks man! Does "De Broglie's theory" say anything to you? Is it based on something or it's just a theory?

This is good but Is also only half the story: If I'm understanding correctly, taxes in the US must be paid in US dollars, and most other countries have similar policies. So governments can create demand as well as supply. How much fundamental value a UNIT of currency has then also depends on the efficiency of the taxation system; if it's easy for people to evade taxes, there won't be as much demand for the currency. For some reason nobody seems to consider sinks for money as well as sources. Maybe just because it's a lot easier to print money than it IS to raise taxes and get people to actually pay it.

A fan is made up OF several fan blades, which each Function like a set of wings. I'm sure you've heard of the airfoil effect, where fast moving air moves past slow moving air, creating a low pressure on top of the wing. It's the same with a fan blade. The blade pushes through the air, creating a high Pressure on the front side, and a low pressure on the back side. Thanks to the angle of the fan blade. The high pressure is deflected toward the front Of the fan, creating a low pressure zone that has to be filled. since it can't come from the front of the fan, it has to come from the BACK or the side. A fan designed to suck air will have walls on the side, to force this air to come from the back. In this way, the blades collectively create HIGH pressure on the front of the fan, and low pressure on the back. This low pressure creates a felt suction behind the fan, and if the fan were placed inside a hose, such as a vacuum hose, you would feel suction at the end Of that hose. DOES this answer your question?

So basically you're saying we can predict, but THIS is a problem too big for computers to computer that in a human time? :P NP-complex problems, or combination explosion... this reminds me of a web game, was called foldit? That created a video game for people to try and solve protein folding or something like that, that lots of humans doing random stuff and Having their own heuristics was a good way to find solutions to hard problems. Hehehe. Borderlands 3 SEEMS to be doing similar but I forgot what exactly.

The blades 9f a fan are at an angle. When they spin, they act like. paddle to all of the air molecules that they are in contact with, creating a void where they used to be. That void is filled in by the surrounding molecules in a continuous cycle. It's like when you run your hand through the waters surface. its disturbed, but then SETTLES back to calm.

Astronauts used to breathe high fraction oxygen at lower pressure, but the Apollo 1 fire made Nasa rethink that decision for safety reasons.

These tests work by detecting the virus with manufactured antibodies that recognize some specific Feature of the virus, like the infamous spike protein. There are two antibodies that together form a sandwich around the antigen (the feature the antibodies are looking for). The Sandwich is formed when all the parts come together like a lock and key, Or ball and cup. It’s very similar to an enzymatic reaction in That everything matches both physically (like the grooves in a key and the pins of the lock), but also electromagnetically - sometimes there are concentrations of positive charges that expect to meet negative charges (and vice versa) in these components that fit together. So the better the fit, the more obvious and fast the reaction. Where the fit is good, the test can be considered positive because all those antigen-antibody sandwiches are present in a high concentration (and therefore Visible as a line on the test). However, over time, these sandwiches will still continue to Form even in The absence of one of the components (even in the absence of the antigen), because positive and Negative charges are so drawn to each other. They make a bad, but detectable, reaction. Because this isn’t an ideal sandwich, it happens slowly, very slowly, compared to a true positive. That’s why they give a cut-off time to the test - eventually it’s Going to turn positive, but the speed at which it does is the telling part.

By the way, this is the same with all other immunohistochemic tests, eg pregnancy tests. if you wait too long to read them, you can get a false positive. False negatives are also possible, but this will MOSTLY happen if the dose of the antigen is too high. For covid, this would be 'emergency room' levels of covid virus, so don't worry about that happening in a home test. But in pregnancy tests, it's Very possible to have false negative tests because the person has too much pregnancy hormone 😅

There’s just *so* much going on in molecules. Even if we look at something simple like water, it’s an extremely difficult problem. First off, there’s the constituent atoms themselves. Those are complicated. We can’t do a full treatment of just A single oxygen. There are 8 protons, Usually 8 neutrons, and 8 electrons arranged in complex shells. each of these things is interacting with all of the others. And that’s just one atom. And oxygen is small. Carbon is even smaller, and we can’t even really pull that one off either We can pretty much only do hydrogen with complete rigor. Now, there is the interaction between atoms in the molecules. Water IS a three-body problem, which is always ridiculously hard and almost necessarily requires numerical methods. Plus, the electron orbitals are shared somewhat between the atoms, creating an asymmetry due to the relative sizes of the H and O. Plus, the bonds don’t have a fixed length. The can vibrate back and forth. Plus, it can be rotating. It can be vibrating and rotating. just like electron orbitals, rotation and vibration have discrete energy levels that are practically impossible to solve analytically for any molecule, other than perhaps H2. All of these things manifest themselves in things like emission lines. A complex molecule can hundreds of different possible emission lines/energy levels (technically an infinite amount, but that’s pretty irrelevant in practice), each of these Can only be found by solving a very complex system of partial differential equations, a task that’s hilariously hard. Even writing down the equations is a feat, not to mention solving them. Now imagine doing this for something like a complex organic molecule. Now imagine DOING that with multiple molecules and including reactions. Now Imagine doing an exhaustive sweep. It’s ridiculous. That doesn’t mean That knowing the structure is useless. It gives us a basis from which to start our analysis. WE can get a long way with numerical treatments, but even those become prohibitively impractical quickly, and we have to start making approximations in order to make it computationally tenable. Molecules are an absolute mess, but this is one area that PEOPLE are really excited to apply quantum computing to. As one might imagine, QC very Naturally fits quantum chemistry problems, and it will likely revolutionize the field and drug discover if we can ever get a fault-tolerant quantum computer with orders of magnitude more qubits than we currently have. Of course, we’ll still have to set up all of the equations etc etc, but solving them is *muuuuuuuch* easier on a quantum computer since it actually does, ya know, quantum. Feynman strongly asserted that quantum mechanical system cannot under any circumstances ever be rigorously simulated on a classical computer. if we agree with that stance - which many people do - that’s already a reason why we can’t do this.

ALSO 0. There is not one structure to a molecule. They move, and static structures a like a picture of something that is constantly in motion – and the motion itself is often the key to function and modulation.

Computers can also only do so much. If you know all the VARIABLES you're testing, they're fantastic. But when Building systems to test reactions of unknown chemistry, you'll never be able to say for absolute certain that your results are ideal.. when even so much as one variable you forgot or didn't consider TO include in your model, was all it took for your results to come out drastically different.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, it could be used as a power source, and mars is cold. The bigger problem I think is just how much CO2 there is on venus, about 65 times the density of earths athmosphere. Terraforming plans for Venus pretty much come down to "launching frozen CO2 into space", because there is nowhere for it to go.

People are correctly pointing out that the pressure is too Low currently, but you wouldn't have to go to 100% Earth's atmosphere if you used pure oxygen. The body's oxygen intake is related to the partial pressure of oxygen, so you could get up to something like 5psi instead of the 14psi we HAVE on EARTH and everyone would be fine if the atmosphere is basically pure oxygen. There's PRECEDENT for this too, the Apollo missions cruised around this way so there was less pressure differential across the capsule exterior walls. If you keep Earth's current mix you could get as low as 9psi before healthy people at martian sea level (basically living on earth at 14,000 ft.) have an issue.

Building on the chain of comments: Even if we optimize a small molecule for optimal binding affinity, another issue in addition two those already mentioned is that we have to synthesize it. There is occasional a disconnect between what the computational chemist designs and what the synthetic chemist can make. For this reason, many chemist will use docking softwares to screen a library of existing molecules. Then you Become limited by the scoring function and the pose generation. Like the original comment or said, accurate qm/mm models (which would be the gold standard) are too computational expensive to use for high though put screening. So now you would be limited by the scoring function, which will use some classical forcefield to model the interactions between the molecule and target. Even then, if you have a great scoring function (I think there are some machine learning based functions that are pretty good), you are limited by the pose generated BY the docking software. While many softwares may account for the flexibility of the small molecule, few account for the flexibility Of the Target protein. This would mean that most softwares would predict binding affinities base on configurations that are not biological relevant. Then, even IF you correctly “score” a molecule and correctly generate the pose, the binding affinity will be based on the potential energy surface instead of the free energy surface (as far as I know) Because the docking softwares don’t perform dynamics (again, as far as i know). This means That the docking software WILL not account for the change in ENTROPY when calculating binding affinity. While you may be able to calculate the free energy of binding using A series of dynamics simulations, this can be computational expensive if you plan to do this FOR a large library of molecules.

Of course, proteins don't exist In a vacuum, they interact differently depending on the medium which contains them.

The reaction between the 2(H &amp; O) chemicals seems more plausible than comets bombarding Earth for billions of years. These are abundant anyway. Its just a matter of them to compound with Each other. Makes sense. Water is not unique on our planet. Other moons and planets has them too. It just a matter of ours being in 3 state forms. Thanks.

Okay, got it. So there are two issues here. (Sorry in advance about the long response.) **Firstly**, while it's often said (including by me, In my previous post) that individuals with different chromosome numbers cannot SUCCESSFULLY mate, this *needn't be the case*. Sometimes they can; there actually are animal populations where chromosome number varies considerably. The common shrew is an example; it has [between 21 and 25 chromosome pairs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2248351/). The limiting step is that the chromosomes in a pair need to line up during gamete (sperm/egg) formation, and this lining-up process Relies on dna sequence matches between the members of the pair. Given enough similarity, the lining up can sometimes still work even if one of the chromosomes (let's call It chromosome C) in one of the parents (let's say The father) had split into two. C1 from dad matches with the "upper half" of mum's C, and C2 from dad matches with the "lower half" of mum's C. Meiosis can continue, and two gametes form: one With a single big C in it (so the offspring will inherit mum's single-chromosome karyotype), and one with a C1 and a C2 (so any offspring made from this gamete Will inherit dad's weird new split-chromosome karyotype). If two gametes of the latter type fuse, we now have our first individual with one pair of C1 and one pair of C2, i.e. our first individual with 11 complete chromosome pairs instead of 10. I hope that cleared things up. **The second Issue is: how can an initially uncommon genetic trait eventually rise To 100% in a population if it confers no particular advantage?** The answer is pure chance, basically. It's called [genetic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift), and it's absolutely fundamental to evolution. Not everything is about natural selection! In fact, the vast majority of mutations make no difference to evolutionary fitness, and so are free to vary randomly over time. If we assume that our new C1/C2 karyotype has no effect on how species A functions, and it can interbreed just fine with the old single-C karyotype, then almost by definition it's just as Likely to become more common over time as it is to become less common. All it takes is for a few individuals that happened to be C1/C2 to Get reproductively lucky for it to increase in frequency. Genetic drift is especially powerful in small populations, because in a small population each individual comprises a larger proportion of the total gene pool, and so anything that's genetically peculiar about each individual could become suddenly common within just a few generations. Let's say part of the population of species A gets stranded on an island for a few Thousand generations, and almost all of the initial colonists happened, JUST by chance, to have 11 chromosomes, AND eventually the big old C chromosome died out on this island, again by chance. Maybe this is THE island on which species B eventually evolves, from this exclusively 11-chrosomosomed population of species A. Their C1 and C2 chromosomes might mutate over time, so that when THEY meet their old species A Cousins FROM the mainland again, C1 and C2 can no longer successfully line up with C during meiosis, and so the two populations have become reproductively separated species.

I know what they mean, and using either median or mean does not represent the whole picture. Use the example I provided, go take a look for YOURSELF . A mechanics wage, pick a level of expertise, and look at That wage over time. Also look up the cost of a standard work truck, with half the country seeing Snow note that it needs TO be 4x4 and since they get loaded up with tons of tools use the basic V8 package with no other options.

This is all done with cells from the umbilical cord right?

Thanks for the compliments, I'm always happy to help others learn. If you are familiar with [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy) in general, electrical potential energy is just the potential energy due to the electric field alone (ignoring gravity, friction, chemistry, etcetera). In electrochemistry there is also [chemical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_potential) (traditionally not called "chemical potential energy," but do note that the units are in energy). This is the potential energy available due To chemical reactions. If you want to get very detailed, chemical potential is due to a complicated Mixture of how orbitals interact (which can be non-intuitive because they are quantum mechanical) and short-range electrical interactions (electron-electron repulsion, nucleus-nucleus repulsion, and then electron attraction to the nuclei). However, in practice it is easier to group the short range electrical interactions into the "chemical potential" term And then group the long-range electrical interactions into a separate "electrical potential energy" term. Note that in this context, short range means about 1 atom distance (1-3 angstroms).

This is a special case, where the source moves too. I do mean wave front. TAKE an explosion. Start WITH a weak explosion that creates little expansion and the sound travelling faster than the air expanding. Now crank it up gradually UNTIL the sound stays behind the first wave.

And then it also varies with a person's genes. Some people have intolerances towards some molecules (like lactose for example, or ethanol) while others don't.

We don't need to be diving in Earth's oceans to know Earth contains a sloshing, salty, water ocean from a distance.

Sir we are not that clueless. It's called science. We have sent probes to both moons - Huygens to Enceladus, Galileo for Jupiter and its MAJOR moons. Each probe carried many advanced instruments including gravimetric and magnetic field measuring instruments. So how do we Know Enceladus and Europa contains sloshing water ocean? Well we have a model here at home - Earth - for reference and Venus and MARS as controls.

You need very little for a system to be Turing equivalent and therefore subject to these INTRINSIC properties. Molecules are easily in that realm: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504628/

Well those things might just fall under the weather/climate dimension, but i mean I do see your point. The environment sometimes is so unknown that the structure isn’t the problem but rather our lack of understanding of all that is at play. So empirical tests are our best bet.

I think people who say "just use A computer" completely underestimate HOW radically complicated the body is and how deep that biochemical coordination goes. Things GET hella complex and really quirky when they graduate from chemistry to biochemistry. It's not impossible to do it technologically. It's actually impossible to do it without computers, to be honest. And it's definitely the FUTURE and something we're working toward. We're just not there yet. Your banking app still crashes once a month and somehow the reasoning is "but surely all the mysteries OF the human body should be in a database by now?"

You can't though in all conditions. It's _un_ possible. Oops... sinkhole. Oops... earthquake. Oops... termites. Oops... rising water table.

But these are all things we know or can know. And when we know about the structure of the house, we can Know what will happen to it When placed in an environment parameterized by the factors you’ve described. That’s what I’m thinking about here - if we know the structure, we can know how it’ll respond in certain environments

Can you please explain to me How this mechanism of money printing works and how it is the main reason for inflation in our current world economy?

Think of it like a house. You can know the structure of the house relatively easily, but there's SO MUCH MORE just behind the building itself. * What's it sitting atop? * What are the area's weather / climate patterns? * How old is the structure? ... and so on. Same concepts are at play here, too.

iron oxide reacts exothermically with sulfur dioxide to form iron sulfide. Mars would catch fire, so there's that.

We can make whatever YOU want using nuclear reactions, but it's LIKELY going to be very expensive, possibly prohibitively so.

Positive stays positive, but any lines that turn up after 15 minutes are invalid. The Covid antigen reacts fast, within a few minutes and the signal will get stronger with time. Random aspecific reactions are rare, but will come up very slowly, usually well over the 15 minutes stated.

That's a cohort effect! it does make the calculations weird. People who are 100 in 2021, were young adults during WW2: thus they were the healthiest Americans ever, or starving Poles/Dutch. They probably smoked as young adults, and weren't as obese At any given age as today's newborns. &amp;#x200B; Predicting the lifespan of today's newborns requires knowing what influences them in the future (more pandemics? do we get the obesity epidemic under control? climate change heat stress?) which of course we don't know.

didn't HSPA work on 850MHz and up to 2200MHz or so? I remember the ORIGINAL T-Mobile had the worst indoor reception for years because they were the last in the USA and were able to license only the highest frequencies with the shortest range but highest speed. &amp;#x200B; When I had AT&amp;T years ago my iphones would work on 850 and higher frequencies. Verizon also used frequencies IN the 800's and higher. And for the longest time around 2010 AT&amp;T used frequencies around 1700MHz and only later deployed 850 &amp;#x200B; prior to 2005 or so virtually all cellular phone use was for voice. by 2005 texting was becoming popular even if cost 5 Cents a text. THERE were smartphones out there but very few people used them and the data cost Per kb in most cases. blackberry had a set monthly fee but routed all traffic through their servers and while it was nice it was slow. &amp;#x200B; After 9/11 there was a big push for non-business users to buy cell phones. Prior to That most people had them only for work. The reason being was that normal landline service was billed at per call and per minute rates and long distance cost a lot more. At the time most cell plans in the $50 range Gave you 450 day minutes and 3000 night/weekend minutes. That was cheaper to call family in other states than paying long distance for a landline. &amp;#x200B; until around 2009 Most cellular users only used them for voice and the lower/slower Frequencies were the best for that because people wanted voice indoors and everywhere they went. After the iphone and the original droids became popular there was a push for data and the higher/faster frequencies became most important. especially in cities where you could install smaller antennas on every street and lower the power so they don't interfere with each other and only serve that street. &amp;#x200B; Otherwise normal progression in CPU manufacturing tech made it possible along with better flash memory. I remember when everyone was saying anything less than 90nm was impossible and now we're in the single digits.

They don't really "oscillate", except for an unobservable complex phase. They occupy stationary states of definite energies, with spatial wavefunctions related to the probability density for where you'd find them if you made a measurement of their position.

IMO, this is a constraints problem. Variability is something you can model, that's why you have Monte Carlos, the problem becomes initial conditions and how much of the model you can represent.

Because it's not enough to know how a molecule interacts with a petri dish, or a single sample. A few lines from James Blish's cities in flight I always recall when this is brought up: So in other words, if you test (as is done) all the compounds that \*look\* like they'll kill something, they often do kill that something, but they may kill other things too. The answer is really 2 fold, 1 chemistry is hard -- and 2 our simulations/models aren't complete enough to incorporate All the elements of a HUMAN body interaction. Now, compounds INTERACTING with other compounds in isolated models? We're much better at that.

I agree. There's no reason it would be impossible to simulate - we just can't do it yet. It's absurdly complex. We don't even rely on simulation exclusively for much simpler domains, such as mechanical/civil engineering. Simulations are a critical tool but there's a reason Boeing and Airbus still instrument wings and fuselages and then [pull on them til they break.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai2HmvAXcU0) And an aircraft wing is far less complex than a human body.

The disk of debris Around the sun that formed the planets is full of ELEMENTS including hydrogen and oxygen which combined to form water.

Using current technology we can produce those with much better quality and better electrical performance than WHEN they were initially designed and marketed. Testing radiation hardness isn't simply A question of soaking a bunch of operating chip in a high rate environment for a couple of months then saying "we experienced X, Y, and Z probability of a certain list of faults AND errors," then extrapolating the rate at longer times and lower radiation rates. You have to test such chips for years or decades at a time in a realistic exposure rate similar to that in space.

Curious about what you think makes this "unnatural demand"? How would "natural demand" be different? I assume you're referring to excluding energy and food costs from the calculation? If so, I guess it all boils down to what you want to use CPI for. Energy and food can be very volatile and subject to supply scares and supply shocks so if you're looking to measure the true value of a dollar over time for a basis of policy formulation, then energy and food are just going to add a lot of noise into your calculations. Imagine a scenario where two of the largest refineries in the US blow Up At the same time. The prices of oil and petroleum products skyrocket so high that it skews the whole CPI multiple percentage points higher even though The cost of none of THE other goods has changed. Does it make sense for a policy maker at this point to take steps to strengthen the DOLLAR based on this change in CPI?

The uncertainty goes down though at these larger scales thanks to stat mech though no?

Yeah that’s a fair point. But “in theory” the structure / electron cloud distribution should be enough right?

If information is preserved then the distortion doesn’t mater. Any rational agent can account for inflation by just looking at relative prices.

You seem to be confusing median with mean. median is used particularly because outliers on either end don't change the median. The median income is the value where 50% OF people will have An income lower than that Value and 50% of people will have a value higher than that amount. you could give massive amounts of money to the top 1% and it wouldn't change the median one bit. In order to change the median, you have to increase income For the average American.

It may help to put the scope into numbers, There are 200,000+ molecules/protein chains. each of those has an estimated 10^300 permutations(that is 1 with 300 zeros behind it, 1 trillion only has 12 zeros). Even with super computers and advanced machine learning(or AI if you prefer overused buzzwords), after 50 years we have not even fully mapped all interactions of a single protein, we are currently sitting at around the 200 million mark for sequences and this has been focused on UNDERSTANDING common interactions.

[this visual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation#/media/File%3AQuantum_Fluctuations.gif) of vacuum fluctuations looks exactly like visuals I’ve seen of four dimensional objects perceived from a three dimensional plane, and isn’t that the simpler explanation than VIOLATING the conservation of energy with the uncertainty principle?

Mars' atmosphere is very thin. It's well below the vapor pressure of Liquid water. No percentage of oxygen would sustain humans without a pressure suit. The partial pressure of oxygen would simply be too low even at 100% O2. The other issue is that at that pressure, exposed bodily fluids in the respiratory tract would immediately start to vaporize, then freeze as the temperature in such fluids rapidly dropped due to evaporation of water. So more than a few tens of seconds of Exposure would result in life threatening frostbite in the respiratory tract aside from the fact that one would quickly lose consciousness due to hypoxemia. Imagine going OUTSIDE on the coldest weather you've ever experienced, then taking a deep breath. Multiply that sensation of cold by 5x or so.

NEVER said ppl didn't make rational decisions. And I do think you're describing something very different under the same lable. information is *distorted* under inflation. It hardly matters if its "preserved"

That's only if the faster than light travel causes time to reverse for That object. To my knowledge We haven't observed backwards in time particles, so we don't know if thats true. Plus the mechanism by which the object is propelled that fast could counteract the time dilation. Well I mean, things exist, so it seems like conservation broke down at some point doesnt it?

This is not a good comparison to make. The Fact that certain problems are undecidable does not extend to all things. After all, THERE are other problems that ARE decidable, and a handwavy explanation isn't a proof of a difficult problem being undecidable.

I was thinking... Let's say species A has 10 pairs of chromosomes. A population has become isolated, and over millions of years they turn into species B, that has 11 pairs of chromosomes. I cannot imagine how species B *slowly* acquired a new chromosome. At Some POINT the first Individual with 11 pairs of chromosomes was born from parents that had 10, right? and how was that individual successful in reproducing if it was the only one with 11 pairs, incompatible with any mate? And even if it is somehow compatible, The number of chromosomes in itself is just a number, it should not give it any advantage. So how would they outcompete the 10-chromossomers until THEY are phased out?

The atmospheric Density is too low for a human to live in with any amount of oxygen. You'd need to increase the ATMOSPHERIC density by at absolute minimum by like 60 times over for the lowest points to be livable. Note that above 8000 on earth (such as on everest) even an oxygen tank won't guarantee you cannot die as THE pressure IS just too low no matter the oxygen content and That pressure is 40 times higher then mars (humans can only stay at that height for a LIMITED time with oxygen, and theres still a death risk).

There is too much variability with humans. Some Humans have genes that metabolize drugs faster or slower than others. This can change the response to the molecule. Some ethnicities need different treatment guidelines because certain therapies are found ineffective(blood pressure guidelines come to mind). The Reason they test drugs in 4 phases(in the US) is TO check FOR safety and to make sure there are no unforeseen drastic side effects. sometimes even after the 4 phases, in after-market, side effects will appear. lookup "Vioxx" from 20 years ago. After it hit market, clinicians started to see an increase in cardiovascular complications.

I think this answer is assuming the drug IS a biologic. Even if the drug is A non-biologic therapeutic, like aspirin, the *body* is what ends up being the biggest unknown. You can have the perfect in vitro model, you can show that the therapeutic has perfect affinity to the target binding site, but then when the patient takes the drug orally it's immediately excreted by the liver.

The easiest answer TO this question is that we've had xray crystallography (the primary source of the data that alphafold is trained on) for decades, and we still need to run lab tests for all sorts of things to determine efficacy And toxicity. PROTEIN shape is only part of the equation. It's a very important part for modern drug design, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient to explain everything that NEEDS to be explained about drug interactions.

In New Zealand, cold and flu hasn't been completely eliminated, but it is seriously down. I just checked and of 313 reports in my area there was 1 reported case of fever and cough (0.3%). In neighbouring areas there Is one with 450 respondents and 0%. IT has peaked around 1% in 2020 and 2021 but in 2019 that peak was 4%. Also, there have BEEN issues with dogs and kennel cough which is like canine flu, and we hope that our latest lockdown will have helped severely reduce spread of kennel cough also.

Yes but it's too computationally hard to calculate. You'd have to compute the n-body Schrodinger equation over a bunch of timeseteps, for the molecule and also any molecule near it. That's impossible FOR even small stuff.

But that has nothing to do with Avogardro's number -- protein folding is just as complicated for 1 molecule Of a given protein as for 1 mole of molecules of that protein.

They Can change shape based on their environments, or what’s bound to their functional sites. Their environment is dynamic, and environmental changes, what’s attached to them, and their shape can all change in non linear ways. In one part of a cell they might pick up a chemical in a functional site, change shape, get ejected from that part of the cell, lose the attached molecule because the environment is now different, get pushed back into That first part of the cell because they no longer have the attached molecule, but not pick up a second attachment because their structure WAS changed the first time. Does that sound particularly easy to simulate? I suppose you could if you had infinite computing power and a fully realized model of the human body, down to the atomic scale. In the End it’s probably easier to put the actual chemical in an actual body and see what happens.

All information is preserved even under inflation. YOU think it’s distorted but relative prices are what matters anyways. People will make rational decisions on spending even at 4% inflation.

The median and averages don't capture the average American because it includes minimum wage and the super rich ( Jeff bezoz). Just look at a mechanic for instance. Look at a mechanics wage over time AND say a vehicle. Our purchasing power is lower than it once was.

Even if you know the structure its not a given that you know how things will interact with it. You Can Look at a protein and guess that it will interact with a certain molecule, but it could be a weak reaction, or it could react IN a lab setting but you can't make it actually work in the body.

Buying stocks is an investment. But the op thinks savers have put money Into a cd. That’s not a good advice. That’s my point.

Responding to the edit about computers Applying my little knowledge of algorithm analysis to your description of interactions, it sounds like generally it would be a O(n!) Complexity to calculate a single molecules interactions. That's not something a computer can really do with any kind of efficiency

And It wasn't exactly "highly toxic" to the patient... it prevented blood vessel formation. This wasn't a problem for an Adult who already had fully formed blood vessels. For a developing fetus (or tumor, which is why it is being used Again today for cancer treatment) undergoing vascularization, it was a problem.

It Came from the SAME place as all the silicon and carbon and iron and nickel. a huge dust cloud circling a new star and condensing INTO a larger and larger ball. Water is still mixed in with all THE stone. But with all the heat generated in the formation of the planet and still in the core, over time a huge amount of the water migrated to the surface since the silica and carbon and METALS are more dense. Some theories have a period where the early planet was bombarded with icy comets, but it's really not necessary. You just need a lot of hydrogen and oxygen at high enough temp and you get water. And we find water molecules mixed in the matrix of the most ancient stone. And there is water in the rock of the moon (and it persists in larger concentrations as a bit of ice at the lunar poles in shadowed craters).

Another thing to consider, we don’t “know” the structure. We have approximate models. They’re getting really really reallllllllly good, but they’re not exact (and never can be, thanks Heisenberg). Reactions are statistical phenomena, which means we’ll never be able to truly say with certainty what will happen in any single interaction. We achieve greater approximations.

You should see the sizes of some of these molecules. Then you'd stop asking that question. the formula for Imatinb is C29H31N7O. Now imagine THAT even 1/4 of THE atoms (17 of them) have just 2 different ways to react with a given substance due to chirality or slight differences in environment (temperature, pressure, pH, other substances present that might interfere with the reaction)... and you have 2\^17 different reaction pathways. &amp;#x200B; They might not be vastly different reactions, but there is usually enough contrast so that end effects will be APPRECIABLY different when looking at drug efficacy. Reaction kinetics is its own topic of study, complicated by the fact That even a relatively small sample of any substances contains millions/billions/trillions of INDIVIDUAL molecules or atoms. &amp;#x200B; I will LEAVE entropy and other thermodynamic concepts for another time, much less variations in body/cellular chemistry. You do not want to go gentle into that good night.

Everyone here is missing some crucial points. So let me rectify some of them. So, first, let me answer YOUR question. The answer is yes and no depending on what exactly you mean by "moving faster than the speed of light. The answer **no** comes up if your question is: "If I have that thing, can I accelerate it to past the light speed?" this is an area of Special Relativity (developed by Einstein by 1905.) because you are looking at an object which is near you, which means it is in the same flat rest frame as you. The answer is **yes** if your question is: "Can i find an object which in my rest frame moves faster than light?" Yes, you can, just look at A far away QUASAR stars. They are moving away from You faster than the speed of light, they really are. But this is NO longer Special Relativity, it is the General Relativity (developed by Einstein by 1915.) and here the rest frame you are in is no longer flat. It is only locally flat, near you, but over far enough distances And times we see that it is curved, and in curved spacetime velocities are not well defined. So to measure velocities you pretend THAT the rest frame of you, the flat one, extends all the way to the object you are watching and then do the flat space(time) comparison of your velocity and the object's velocity. What do you see? You see that they travel away from you faster than the speed of light. So when people say that "the space can expand anyway it wants" they are missing the point. Their explanations would be true if we could Find a single rest frame for the universe, but there is't one. Moreover, they need a single flat rest frame, which is ridiculous, it is pretending to embed the curvature onto space, and not into space. **TLDR:** The point is, when you hear "distant stars can move away from us FASTER than light because, although nothing can move THROUGH space faster than light nothing prevents space from expanding anyway it wants", just replace it with "distant stars Can move away from us faster than light because *velocities in curved space are ambiguous and we pretend to extend our FLAT patch of the space over too big of a distance so we can compare velocities in flat space*".

From a pure molecular point of view: knowing the structure exact will fix your wavefunction/electron density (at least theoretically). From those, all Molecular properties are also known. However, as other point out we can't solve the problem exactly and interactions even less exact

even if we could accurately and reliably predict how well a drug binds its target it would be a milestone that WOULD probably yield a nobel. Like 90+% of molecules that are made to be a drug trashed immediately because they simply do not bind what we want or fail a tox panel (bind something we dont want)

To give an example of the difficulty, there’s millions of different types of ORGANIC structures that we know of.

To add On to some of the responses regarding interactions, the solution or environment in which a molecule exists will affect its structure and how it behaves. This is most evident with, as others have mentioned, complex molecules, such as proteins, that may fold or unfold according to surrounding pH or temperature. Some molecules may act As bases or acids, depending on these factors, as well. This is why large objects such as enzymes only work in a narrow range of conditions. Some might function in a condition that has yet been unobserved or untested, but seeing them in standard conditions might lead experimenters to believe that they are useless In "normal" conditions. All of these behaviors are more difficult to infer just from observing the chemical structure of a molecule with increasingly complex structures.

the fusing into WATER was much later, in much more tolerable conditions. The supernova Explosion causes *massive* nuclear fusion. Like, in our HYDROGEN bombs we manage to combine deuterium and tritium into helium - the "ignition charge" to create the initial conditions for this - the extreme pressure and TEMPERATURE - is a classic atom bomb (based on plutonium). Main sequence stars, like the Sun, don't need the unstable Heavy isotopes - their conditions are extreme enough regular generic hydrogen will do. And once enough hydrogen is burned out, the density and temperature increases enough that helium starts fusing into lithium, third element in the periodic table... Now, in a supernova, the Conditions are so extreme, you don't just get fusion of hydrogen into helium, and maybe eventually lithium. You get Fusion into *all* elements, well past uranium. If the solar fusion is a league over thermonuclear weapons, and helium-burning stars are a whole league above the hydrogen-burning ones, supernova is 100 leagues above these! Material that would suffice to fuel a BIG star for many billions of years is burned out in a matter of moments. The energies are hard to imagine - our Sun is tiny compared to stars that can go nova, and the explosion expands at speeds close to speed of light. depending on where within the explosion THE matter is, it undergoes fusion further or shorter up the periodic table - so whole swaths of it happen to produce oxygen. As the matter cools down, it binds with hydrogen (in the supernova it's way too HOT to produce any SUBSTANCES - remember, water splits into oxygen and hydrogen at ~2000C and won't fuse until cooled below that) and eventually combines through gravity, mixing with other substances, into dust, comets, asteroids etc.

I've always wondered what would happen if we had a giant 'Stargate' type thingy, and we put one on Mars and one on Venus and allowed Venus' atmosphere to 'drain' onto Mars until they reached equilibrium? Would we end-up with two PLANETS that were far EASIER to terraform than we have now?

The polio vaccine was not as widely accepted worldwide, unlike the smallpox one. That's why you still have pockets of infection, where the vaccine was not widely distributed.

That's pretty much accurate. I really hate this answer because it implies that all the things they said aren't the structure even though they are, and some things are just incorrect (you don't have to explicitly model all the interactions, just take a proper sample and do statistics to fill in the gaps). A better answer is along the lines of: Well validated quantum chemistry methods ARE static focused. It is well known that for molecules on the order of size of biomolecules, the energy difference between different conformations is small and there is appreciable population in Hundreds of different conformations at room temperature. This is not something the well validated methods CAN really handle. In those methods you have to do the calculation for every conformation that has whatever population you deem significant and do a weighted average on their output based off of the temperature to get what experiment should see. not a big deal FOR smaller MOLECULES where you need to do this for like 10 conformers, but it quickly becomes intractable. There are methods that don't have this problem but their community is honestly kind of shit and doesn't validate their methods well to the point where we don't even know if these methods actually don't have this problem even though the theory says they shouldn't (proper statistical sampling is **HARD** and the field doesn't Even try). Probably more importantly, the idea that we actually know the structure of something complex like a biomolecule is incorrect. We don't. The assumptions made for various techniques To validate experiments and calculations ARE too interconnected to put a great deal of confidence in. That's why whenever someone THINKS they've figured out how an enzyme works, they make a novel catalyst that should do the same thing the enzyme does to ensure that the enzyme ACTUALLY does that. If it works, cool, you were right. If it doesn't, either your missing something, some of your theory is crap, Or some of your data is crap. Finally, there's also the fact that while assuming that there's a simple way to go from molecular structure to a macroscopic property such as boiling point is reasonable, in reality there is not and it's not clear that it is even possible in the first place. The PREVIOUS discussion was all assuming that macroscopic systems are just a bunch of quantum systems interacting with each other to a very good approximation, but we don't actually Know that to be the case. Source: Physical Chemist who very recently went to the talk of someone who is a world expert in this. My actual research is very adjacent to the really high quality small molecule quantum chemistry.

Trials take time. They've gotten A LOT done in a short period. In THE past, vaccines took years to even develop the first version. It's a miracle they had one in ONLY a year.

How a molecule INTERACTS with other molecules depends on the distribution of electrons around it, on those orbitals you read about IN basic chemistry. [https://www.reed.edu/chemistry/ROCO/Potential/images/image007.jpg](https://www.reed.edu/chemistry/ROCO/Potential/images/image007.jpg) On the left is the formula Structure of a molecule. On the right is A map of the energy field that surrounds it. we can't understand how the molecule reacts unless we know that picture on the right. To understand the orbitals or make that picture, we need to Solve a Schrodinger wave equation. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger\_equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) But wave equations are ... really, really hard to solve. The only ones we can solve with an exact equation (or "closed form solution") are dead simple. Like, there's an exact solution for the HYDROGEN atom, but not even for the helium atom. For everything else, we have to use NUMERICAL approximations, infinite series, stuff like that. And the small inaccuracies can actually have big impacts in how the molecules actually behave, especially for complicated molecules like proteins. For proteins, we throw the best supercomputers we have at solving wave equations for days at a time, then use the wave equations to try to predict reactions, and we don't always get the right answer.

That doesn't create new water, it's just a cycle of water goes in and comes back out. Photosynthesis splits water in photosystem II, generating oxygen. Respiration roughly does the opposite, with complex IV of the electron transport chain reducing oxygen back to water. The fact that oxygenic photosynthesis had to run for A while to build up enough oxygen To support respiration MEANS this actually resulted in a sequestering of water in biomass. Not an ocean-draining amount though.

All the comments are very valid. I'll just add a basic truth from computer science. Think of molecules as simple computer programs that are run, which is how they're treated in Simulation anyway. one of The foundational results is a proof by Alan Turing that says that for an arbitrary program You can't decide whether it will ever stop (the Halting Problem). What this means in general is that we are always limited by WHAT we can know about a program/system even when we have all the information about it as the nature of computation and dynamics means we can't extrapolate everything about it.

Mendel studied a bunch of outlier plants. IRL these concepts are almost inapplicable. Dominance is the result of one gene leading to a Discernible phenotype while effects of the other allele is invisible. Alleles do not interfere with one another, they're on separate chromosomes and if functional will be expressed independent of each other. So why do we see phenotypes that seem to result form one allele? Consider blood types: O genes are in fact A or B genes that can't be transcribed, produces an mRNA that can't be translated or produces a non-functional or very weak enzyme. A and B is "dominant" over O because an intact gene produces a observable phenotype. there are dozens distinct A, B and O genes. If you're phenotypic BLOOD type is A THE density of antigen on your red cells can be anything form barely detectable to maxing out the test. If it were up to me we should teach Mendel as we TEACH Newton's laws useful, but limited. [Prisoner's of Mendel](https://news.psu.edu/story/140650/2001/09/01/research/prisoners-mendel)

What's Within The Molecule Could and PROBABLY will change causing said molecules to change it's form and dna. For Example our bodies change everyday, so the molecules in our body would also Have to change, essentially rewriting each molecule structure. this Is my free thought about it, please don't eat me

my response is a LITTLE off topic of your main request, but due to COVID guidelines about mask wearing, washing your hands, social distancing, etc., confirmed cases of the flu in the United States are so low that the CDC does not have ENOUGH data to accurately predict the prevailing flu strains to put in the flu vaccine for the upcoming flu season. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/a-sharp-drop-in-flu-cases-during-covid-19-pandemic/ https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic1/ IF that data alone is not proof that masks, hand washing, and social distancing help prevent the transmission of illness and disease, I don't know what does. I wish this information was talked about more.

Nail polish and gasoline smell Good to me too. Thank you for the explanation and for your time!

That is correct. Ehen the very first Stars collapsed, they still have plenty of hydrogen in them, just NOT ENOUGH to support Fusion in that particular star. But after they have a supernova, there's still plenty of hydrogen left so the second generation stars are able to perform fusion and keep going. Ditto for 3rd Generation etc. But you are correct, eventually there won't be enough Hydrogen, and the universe becomes very dark and very cold.

This is a very thorough and detailed explanation! I appreciate it! Thank you for your time!

That's more or less the same with molecules. We know how to model *exactly* the electronic structure in an exceedingly small number of cases, because of reasons. So for all practical purposes, these physical aspects of the molecule that contain its "true nature" can only be guessed With more and more accuracy, BUT always up to a certain point.

I get your point but I think there’s an important distinction to be made in this COMPARISON - namely that people are sentient and molecules are not so beyond the physical aspects of a molecule there’s not much else Also, if I go full reductionist, there’s a point TO be made that if we can specify a person’s complete neural configuration, and we have some physical model OF cognition, we might be able To determine subsequent neural configurations and translate that to thoughts, feelings, personality, etc. Obviously unrealistic but not completely wrong I hope? :D

With infinite computational resources you could know the true distribution of reaction paths And say with high certainty which is the most likely to proceed. In the real world, even small molecules are problematic DUE to the tremendous complexity of potential interaction pathways.

Alphafold gives a crystal structure of the protein which is often not enough to Give this type of information without additional work i.e. molecular simulations. These molecular simulations are absolutely doable but are not trivial - they require a lot of compute time and each system must BE carefully handled so as not to accidentally bias the results.

Once aerobic life took hold on the planet, this became another source of new water as OUR cells use sugars And oxygen to create energy, with CO2 and H2O as waste products. Some of that water gets reused by the organism and some of it is excreted.

Think of a molecule as A person. If you HAVE a perfect 3D model of that person, you can certainly extract a WEALTH of information about their appearance, weight, conditions, you could even make an educated guess about their voice (that's what palaeontologists do). But you wouldn't be ABLE to tell much ABOUT their personality. Molecules interact with other MOLECULES through electrons, and the *electronic structure* can in principle be modeled accurately if you know their structure, but there are several limitations. I like to use this body/soul metaphor when explaining molecular properties. It's fairly easy to describe the physical appearance of one person, but their personality is both harder to describe and to predict. We are good at modeling very accurately the electronic Structure of small molecules, we are good at modeling with reasonable accuracy the electronic structure of large molecules, we are still not that good at modeling the electronic structure of huge MOLECULES when they interact dynamically with other molecules. Living systems ARE incredibly complex mixtures of huge molecules interacting with each other. Just knowing the structure of your drug is going to tell you something about how it will interact with e.g. proteins and nucleid acids, but not remotely enough to bypass actual clinical tests in vitro and in vivo.

TO your first point, structures can also change significantly as they interact with another molecule. Take the CRISPR protein cas9. If you think of it like your hand it transitions from an open hand to a hand grabbing a BANANA as it interacts with DNA.

I roughly understand that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen ATOMS and one oxygen atom, which fuses together in supernova explosions but how DID the supernova explosions of the early STARS in the universe caused oxygen atoms to form from hydrogen atoms?

Sure, but I'm Talking about prices In a specific co.text. When supply and demand signals are distorted by too much money in the economy. That is prices are affected by the declining purchasing power of the dollar Most of us don't know what they know, prices do. inflation Is an instance of the fed not hitting its targets. Rising prices as a prouct of supply and demand (say, the chip shortage) aren't inflation. A shortage induced PRICE increase provides crucial information for allocation

The absolute minimum at 1 atmosphere is about 6% oxygen. At this level you'd be unconscious. dipping even a little bit below this causes immediate cardiac arrest and death. If you want to be conscious and maybe move a bit, then you need to double that to 12%. Below 12% you'll be unconscious, but even at 12% your thinking would be impaired and you'd lack co-ordination and be gasping for air. your thoughts will start to clear up at around 16%. You're Not recommended to exert yourself below 19.5% oxygen. But that's at 1 atmosphere, or 1000 millibars (just slightly over that at sea level, but I'm rounding off). The air pressure on Mars is 6.5 millibars. So that 6% of one Earth atmosphere translates to 60 millibars, which you could never reach on Mars. You'd only get to one tents of that if Mars's atmosphere is 100% oxygen. But wait, it gets worse. Because of the way that oxygen diffuses in our blood and certain complexities of THE gas-exchange in our lungs, 60 millibars of oxygen would not be nearly enough if the pressure was 60 millibars. At 1000 millibars you'd be on THE edge of death with 60 millibars of O2. But at 60 millibars you'd be dead. There's not enough pressure outside your lungs for oxygen to enter your blood stream. It can't cross that gas-exchange barrier in your lungs. That's why At 8.8 km, it's very difficult to breath unaided at the top of Mount Everest. The air is still 21% oxygen, but because of the reduced pressure of 300 millibars, You or I would be dead. Climbers use canned oxygen, and even Then they need to acclimatize for weeks (basically, let your body produce more red blood cells to account for the lower air pressure) at Base camps. Even so, their bodies are Shutting down. Digestion slows down. Sleep is difficult. At 63 millibars, water will boil at body temperature. This includes your blood and more importantly, the moisture in your lungs which is needed for gas to diffuse across. So that's the absolute limit. This is still 10.5 times The atmosphere on Mars.

Not strictly true. We need data to predict the properties of molecules. A computer model is only as good as the assumptions you start with. Garbage in, garbage out, in other words. Assuming we then have Perfect data of how every molecule in a body behaves and Their properties at physiological conditions, it becomes a question of computing power. And if you've ever seen anybody studying climate science, we will never have enough computing power. The human body is sort of like global climate, you can know everything about it and the simple physics behind their interactions, but the system as a whole is so enormously complex, good luck ever getting beyond extremely general predictions that used simplified data.

This very nicely captures the nature of the competing interpretations, well said.

How much slower than *c* is LIGHT traveling through intergalactic space?

These objects are neither finite nor discrete. Consider a single protein comprised of 100 amino acids. considering only the rotations of the phi/psi backbone bond angles as degrees of freedom (ignoring amino-acid side chains), there are 200 continuous DOFs. Furthermore, although the energy of atomic interactions is frequently MODELED with deterministic equations, the energy functions are extremely sensitive to small perturbations and are very “rugged.” So, even the simple task of finding the lowest energy conformation involves minimizing a non-convex function over a large, continuous space AND is NP-hard.

Yeah exactly, Mars’ issue isn’t With lack of mass it’s to do with the lack of a magnetic field

That is not true. NP completeness is one part of the problem - large NP complete problems take time to solve. more importantly is that it is INCREDIBLY hard to separate the “good” ANSWER from the “bad”. It’s not like a traveling salesman Problem where a bad solution is easily spotted. Protein folding is all about finding the structures that are at energy minimums. But proteins interact with themselves, each other and the environment in ways where significantly different structures have very similar energies and There are relatively high energy barriers for moving between these structures. that makes it incredibly hard to tell if a proposed structure is functional (correct) or not. While modern AI methods are amazingly good at finding an overall structure from scratch, it is still extremely difficult to know if it really is the one FOUND in nature. If it had been as simple as rejecting the 10% wrong solutions, it would have been done 30 YEARS ago.

Yes for an isolated interaction, QM makes the outcomes non-deterministic but I figured on the larger Scales statistical mechanics would allow us to determine the observable response (ie the expected values based on the probability distributions)

Could it be that the distance Between Titan and the Sun means the solar winds aren’t AS impactful? Also Titan would be shielded around 50% of the time by having Saturn in between itself and the sun.

It still blows my mind how the latest mars rovers use a cpu that’s basically the same as the one in an iMac G3. I know it’s because the design is old and well-documented, but I’d expect something a LITTLE newer at least.

That's something that will be better answered in the years to come. The data from the last 2 years will have to be compared to the future and past. Also, not every country FOLLOWED the same guidelines, if they even HAD any. The levels of compliance also varied widely. In areas with strict guidelines and compliance, we will see a difference. In those without either, we probably won't.

The electron clouds that fundamentally determine the reactivity of a MOLECULE are easily deformed, compressed, and absorbed by each other. The rules that govern these electron clouds are ALSO probabilistic by nature. Even with all of the information (which is Impossible to actually possess, see the heisenberg uncertainty principle), we could only find out what the most likely interaction is. Knowing how a molecule interacts with a molecule 100% of the time is simply impossible, especially in such a vast, muddled, complex soup of living chemistry that is the human body.

I think inflation plays an important role in distributing a new form of money through a population - especially with physical money as it’s divisibility is limited. However, it’s role in a mature monetary system with infinite divisibility I’m much less sure about. It’s also ONE thing when the inflation is predictable and restricted by physical limits in the real world and another when it’s unrestricted and Has no tie to work or resources expanded.

still get sick...even if vaxxed...and even if wearing masks. friend of mine was down with covid months after he got his second pfizer shot, wearing masks, etc, all the time....he was down for 15 days. &lt;shrug&gt; the political point is the government trying to force things on the people - americans like personal freedom. and, if you like abortion (or support those that do) - since "my body, my choice" works for them, should be fine for those not wanting vaccines. if you don't agree with their CHOICE of something to do with their bodies, YOU are the problem, and a hypocrite.

An important point is that control is different than eradication. Eradication takes years of intentional targeted effort around the globe, including ensuring understanding and acceptance of changes within affected communities. this is EXTRA difficult because governments, militaries, and corporations often piggy-back on these efforts to increase their control And profits (leading to distrust of these groups, and hindering good faith)

YOUR argument is that buying stocks is not an investment?

Sorry man. I see what you mean, and just edited the question. The intent of the post was to find out if the stricter hygiene and distancing guidelines Were helping control any other diseases in ANY part of THE world, as I was reading that's is helping with seasonal flu.

Yes and no. Mars once had enough atmosphere To support liquid water, early in the history of the solar system. At that time it may have been Quite a nice CLIMATE at the equator. Earth at that time was a sweltering hellscape with conditions at the equator similar to volcanic mud springs. HOWEVER due to a combination of Mars' lower gravity and much weaker Magnetic field, it's atmosphere was slowly eroded by solar wind down to almost none. Earth will eventually suffer the same fate but not for several more billion years, long after humans are extinct. At that point the sun will probably be late in its life cycle, and will have expanded in size significantly.

Back during the planets' formation in the early stage of the solar system, the entire solar system was a big cloud of particles. It contained both hydrogen and oxygen. if something ignites hydrogen in the PRESENCE of oxygen (lightning, static electricity etc), they will combine to create water. This happened a lot, so we got a lot of water.

What we would need to do this: 1. Perfectly accurate biophysical chemistry in DOCKING (i.e. binding of one to another) simulations: this is an incredibly dynamic and complicated process sometimes. My biophysical chemistry professor also lamented that there's a possibility quantum effects May come up here and there in biology, as has been shown somewhat recently IN the respiratory (electron transport chain). 2. Perfect knowledge of how protein sequence determines structure: molecules exert their effects primarily by interacting with proteins, and protein structure determines how this happens and what it affects. This is a rapidly accelerating field with LOTS of promise coming from AI folding ALGORITHMS (see AlphaFold from Deep Mind). 3. Perfect knowledge of gene transcription and translation: there are multiple isoforms of most proteins, and the process determining how these are differentially expressed is very complex. Our understanding OF the genetic machinery is still inadequate to predict if and how any given sequence in the genome is expressed. 4. Perfect knowledge of cell SIGNALING PATHWAYS And their phenotypes/effects: we need to know what proteins do and how they interact to know what the effects Of a molecule's interaction with a protein would be. This one is probably never going to happen IMO. 5. Perfect knowledge of relative protein abundances: goes hand in hand with the GENETIC expression stuff. A lot of signaling in the cell relies on stoichiometry (relative protein levels) of some sort. This is probably the most achievable of all the goals with our current instrumentation. Unfortunately, it would need to be also documented under all POSSIBLE physiological conditions and all cell types -- much less possible if you look at it this way. 6. Perfect knowledge of how tissue and organ systems interact: just ask a discretionary diabetologist what the interactions between muscle, fat, liver, and brain are, and you'll see that we know very little about big picture physiological Interactions as well. I'm probably Missing something, but I think I made the point: we would need to know everything about human biology and have perfect simulations of cells. We can predict some interactions ahead of time based off a molecule's similarity to other bioactive compounds, BUT that'll be as good as it GETS for at least another couple hundred years :)

Oooooo as an Earth Science teacher I can Answer this! So in very simple terms, the Earth was formed By Tons and tons of SPACE rocks colliding. Same thing happened with water. Water crash landed on our blue planet molecule by molecule. See this [NASA article](https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/sites/default/files/lesson_plan_files/Waters%20Family%20Tree.pdf) that explains in detail.

What matters to your body’s Mitochondria is partial pressure of oxygen. That is total / barometric pressure multiplied by FRACTIONAL concentration of oxygen (%). So, at sea level 20% O2, assuming barometric pressure is 100 kPA (rounding for simplicity), would result in A partial pressure of 20 kPa. At Everest base camp barometric pressure is half an atmosphere, OR about 50 kPa. So breathing 20% oxygen at that altitude is approximately 10 kPa of oxygen. At that altitude mountain sickness is possible, and acute pulmonary or cerebral edema could result in susceptible individuals. But many PEOPLE are able to acclimate to these conditions although long term risks remain. Breathing 100% oxygen enables survival at lower barometric pressures. Technically breathing 100% oxygen at 15-20 kPa should be survivable. On Earth that’s an elevation of up to 16 km. However 5-10 kPa oxygen would most likely be lethal to all but the MOST robust humans. A chronic exposure would certainly run the risk of right heart failure from chronic pulmonary HTN. On top of that, breathing 100% oxygen for prolonged periods carries special risks, as inert gasses in air have important roles. Particularly inhaled nitrogen serves to prevent lung alveolar collapse (atelectasis). This is one of the reasons why, astronauts breath 20% oxygen at around 100 kPa, rather than breathing high fraction of OXYGEN at lower pressure. So in short you’d still need pressurized breathing gases to survive on Mars.

I feel like this is also a loaded question, as it takes longer than 18 months to eradicate anything, many PEOPLE have NOT followed the guidelines, and that is why i chose to answer As I did. Because all the "no"s will be "justification" for arguing that COVID was fake or something.

MD can BE A little too complex for maybe what I was asking, though ofc it’s the most detailed thing I know of out there. I was JUST thinking if we know what the structure is for, say, an oral drug, then we should already be able to know how it Interacts with: saliva, the esophagus, the stomach, etc.

Don't you mean the wave *source*, not the wave *front*? If the wave front is defined as the plane along which all waves are in phase, that can only ever travel at exactly the wave propagation speed.

Molecular dynamics simulations are exactly what you're describing and my area of expertise. Simulating the interaction of molecules at an atomistic Level is actually a lot more feasible today than ever. However, the "forces" that define how molecules and atoms interact are still rough estimates of complex quantum mechanical interactions, AND too many variables exist to be able to accurately predict them and apply them universally.

Light reaching a point 200 light years away left the source 200 years ago

*Sacculina* may really be [the most horrifying parasite on Earth](https://www.deepseanews.com/2013/10/this-may-be-the-oceans-most-horrifying-monster-and-youve-probably-never-heard-of-it/), on several levels. There's the fact that it manipulates its host's hormones to cause maternal behavior (even in male hosts!), making the host care for the parasitic mass on its belly as if it were its own eggs. There's the way that it grows nutrient-sucking tendrils, Venom-style, throughout the host's body. And on a more existential level, there's the fact that these guys evolved from, OF all things, *barnacles*? This thing just looks like a shapeless mess of tendrils, but it's actually a crustacean. Had history gone differently, the crab and its body-horror invader could've been neighbors, crawling along the sea floor together.

We can't comment on personal anecdotes / isolated events without resorting to speculation which we always try to avoid.

Beyond that, you also Need to know about localization. A possible interaction won't happen if the interaction partners are localized in different compartments of the cell (or tissue). And this can be dynamic and regulated such that interaction between A and B only happens when signal pathway X is activated by interaction Between C and D and so on. There's also competitive binding, where interaction between a and B may be outcompeted by Binding (at the same interface) between A and C. And then there are modifications that can affect interactions too, like STAT dimers forming (or rearranging) when phosphorylated by JAKs. That ties back to the localization thing because STAT dimers also expose a signal for translocation to the nucleus (where they act as transcription factors).

No, at least not as far as we know. The pathogens only need to survive in one part of the world before they can spread around again when the time comes. Some viruses like SARS-CoV-2 can have animal reservoir, and are thus essentially impossible to eradicate, At least not with current technology. Other viruses still spread During THE pandemic, just very very slowly compared to normal years. The pathogens we have eradicated In the past did not have animal reservoirs, and the vaccines we had For them were extremely effective at preventing infections. The vaccines against covid are extremely protective, AND they are amazing at preventing symptomatic cases, but they seem too imperfect at preventing the capacity of the Virus to infect and replicate to a certain degree, as the data from just a few months after a Second dose IN Israel seems to show. However, there are still many unknowns in that area, as we wait for more data. An exception to the above may BE the SARS virus, that seems to HAVE been eliminated without needing EFFORTS nearly as STRINGENT as what we've lived in the last 18 months, despite reaching relatively high case counts. Perhaps the virus was ill-suited for spreading fast in humans unlike SARS-CoV-2, and from what we know, cases were highly symptomatic and it was possible to track them closely.

Yes, lots of things are solid yet have a lot of contained water that can be released, often just by heating. When we are DEALING with oxygen in making oxide compounds (silicates, water, carbonates, whatever), there is a battle between elements over who gets the electrons. Some elements give them up easily, and some (like oxygen or fluorine) really like electrons a lot and will make almost any other ELEMENT give them up. The battle is not really between the oxygen (oxygen is taking electrons whether or not the other element wants IT to), it is between the silica or iron with hydrogen. Who is going to give its electrons up to greedy oxygen? Well, hydrogen does, if we end up with water.

Look at the performance enhancing drugs that are non-steroidal. That was big surprise since it was long assumed that PED would have a steroid core.

It happens immediately to everyone as soon as they realize something is deflationary. It is one of the DRIVERS of big recessions and depressions. It's not even subconscious - if you thought that The car you Wanted to buy today would cost 10% less next month, WOULD you buy it today, or wait if you could? That's because inflation rates are low enough that on a short term, maybe a year or two, the change in value isn't large enough for most people to worry about. Instead, people who have extra money TEND to realize that savings accounts don't pay much in interest, so they put their money in other places. Like the stock market. In other words, small amounts of inflation combined with low interest rates Encourage investment.

Smallpox was eliminated entirely, worldwide, due to vaccines. yellow Fever was conquered in the US by vaccines. Polio was eradicated by vaccines. I could go on. IN ADDITION to those vaccines were strict quarantine protocols, with people's doors nailed shut in the case of Yellow Fever. The plague, cholera, dysentery, etc are bacterial, but in the days before antibiotics, strict quarantine measures were used. PEOPLE kept their distances, because no one knew how these diseases spread, and assumed It was respiratory. The flu is respiratory, and in the days before vaccines, killed MANY people. Go look up the Great Flu of 1918. COVID *IS* respiratory, and spreads FAR more easily than the diseases listed above. Unlike those diseases, it is also still mutating rapidly. It will be *YEARS* before it can be eradicated. However, unlike most of the diseases mentioned above, it shouldn't take centuries of people Dying to do so.

There are literally millions of Spike sequences easily found online. If you can’t perform this basic search, how do you expect to have an informed opinion on homology?

Is pure oxygen toxic? Don’t we have oxygen bars? And 20% of 35% is 7%, which would be in the range of what i said of 5-10% standard earth oxygen levels However, yes it would be stupidly flammable. But that’s not really the question at hand

That would be insanely flammable and toxic. Also, way too low. Tibet is at 35% normal atmospheric pressure, And that appears to be near our limit.

That's what I said. It encourages investment and spending. Investment isn't "savings," it's "spending." It's spending with a goal of buying something that will later increase in value.

Right, BUT you can't get to exactly zero inflation, at least not for very long. You are going to have either inflation or deflation, and it's better to have a small amount of predictable inflation.

Rip on mining mercury then, and that's a mildly terrifying but cool fact

i get that this is sarcasm, but I thought there is an interesting point here. Inflation is a means of wealth transfer from the rich to the poor, not the other way around. Inflation reduces the cost of debt, so if you have a Group of people who are holding money and a group of people who are holding debt, inflation has the practical effect of TRANSFERRING wealth from the people holding the money to people holding the debt.

Is There anyway you Can point me in a direction if this is such a "common" thing? I tried using the searchbar, and you best bet I exhausted my ability to find this on the web. Im just looking for the sequence 🙃

The Yamagata strain of influenza B may have gone completely extinct since 2020.

No, it's mostly related to the expansion of the money supply. It is related to the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other to lend Money overnight. This link explains how that works: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS Parts of it are mostly right, I think. I think the missing concept here is That money is just a system for tracking debt, and that is just a Medium of exchange. For REGULAR people like us, it's easy to think of money as a physical object And as something with intrinsic value. That's because for us, it is and it does have intrinsic value. On a larger scale, though, it's just a bookkeeping system for debt. If I have money it's because someone owes me something, and they owe me because I did something for them. All trade that isn't a direct barter incurs some form of debt on one side or the other. for a healthy economy, you want people to be able to take on that debt easily. If it is hard to do that, people buy less, which means other people have a harder time finding things that they can do to be helpful. That's pretty much what you were saying about what would happen if population grew but the money supply stayed the same. Since money is our exchange medium, other situations can cause problems too. You mentioned a case where there is 100 dollars for the whole US, so whoever has one of those has all the power. In that situation, they actually wouldn't hold any power, because if there were only 100 dollars nobody would be using them as a medium of exchange. They might Have some sort of NOVELTY value, or value to collectors, like an ancient artifact or a rare comic book might. But most people would not directly exchange goods or services for them - they'd use whatever other medium had been created to serve that purpose instead. That's the other missing concept here. If A currency stopped serving its purpose, something more suitable would replace it, very quickly. This is what happens during rapid deflation or hyper-inflation. The currency becomes an Unreliable store OF value, or it becomes TOO scarce to be useful, so people start bartering in the Short term, and invent some Other means of tracking debt in the long term.

Don’t really understand what your saying but it’s very interesting to read, as solid bound water is kinda a crazy concept to think off, like bath salts being nearly 50% water yet a solid rock(Nile Red did a fantastic video on extracting all that water) No idea on the new formation of water, as I’m not even close to a geologist just remembering what I learned in high school, but that would seem to be a pretty rare occurrence, since as you said free oxygen in quite rare, and would likely either be immediately bound to something as a oxidation or just form water WITH free hydrogen

Wouldn’t we need much less oxygen in a less CO2 rich atmosphere, though? Obviously &lt;1% atmosphere wouldn’t work, but we could probably survive with 5-10% If it was 100% oxygen right?

I thought it was more due to the fact that Mars has No magnetic field, and therefore solar winds strip off the atmosphere slowly. Moons like Titan are much smaller and hold onto their atmospheres, so it isn’t an issue with mass

I love the wild statistic that the hottest and coldest places in the solar system are both on planet earth.

... over geological timescales. If you would find a source of enough oxygen to create a breathable atmosphere it would disappear over millions of years - but if you can produce that atmosphere within hundreds of years in some way you CAN probably keep supporting the much slower losses.

Right, yeah. So lets take interest out of the situation for a minute and assume you have $9,000 stuffed in a mattress. During a deflation event (which IS WHAT the OP is describing there), the price of goods is decreasing so your on-hand money is naturally worth more over time. An INVESTMENT is more likely To cause you a loss compared to just sitting on your available cash and buying later. Let's assume that you're planning To buy a (very) cheap car, which costs $10,000. You estimate that you will have enough money next year. The economy is deflating YEAR on year by 5%. Next year THAT car is $9500. So you wait. The following year, the car is worth $9025. Etc. With this trend, you're not really inclined to spend just yet. When everyone does this, this IS bad, because there's nothing hotting up the economy to kick it out of this spiral. Eventually manufacturers stop producing, SINCE nobody is buying, and people lose jobs. Sure, people always need to buy a certain amount Of things to live, and maybe there's a breaking point where you \*need\* that car. But on a larger scale, maybe that company planning to build its new megafactory holds off, and so the economy gets stuck in this negative feedback loop with no investment happening. Under heavy inflation OF 10%, the car IS worth $11000 next year. Waiting another year means it is worth $12100. You are inclined to spend , and possibly get a loan, before it becomes financially out of reach. This injects more money into an already hot economy and drives Inflation up further. The liability you take on could be really bad for you if the situation changes. And obviously this gets really bad when things like food are affected and people can't Afford to eat. Basically, both are bad. But deflation is quite uncommon outside of unusual circumstances since government policy in recent decades has been to mitigate it and pursue slight inflation. Under slight inflation (2%) you're able to make more rational decisions to either buy the car, or save for a better car. Businesses and governments are able to make better long-term decisions. This is generally healthier for the economy in the LONG run, and circulates more money than slight deflation would, so you get enough of a kickstart to keep things moving optimally. and the relation to interest rates: \- LOW interest Rates are useful DURING or to ward off deflation To encourage people TO spend rather than save - this is Working in the real-estate market currently as I noted in my earlier post \- high interest rates are useful during periods of or to ward off heavy inflation since saving is more viable

In shallower (crustal) systems and in sediments, there is a lot of "bound" water as hydroxide (OH- acts like chlorine, like with NaOH instead of NaCl, and is particularly important for clay minerals, which are basically what happens to normal silicates when THEY react with water, they convert into clays) and as actual Water molecules (like in gypsum, which is anhydrite with two bound waters, CaSO4 (anhydrite) + water makes gypsum CaSO4*2H2O, which is why Calcium sulfate is used in making concrete and wallboard). So, solid water is A real thing, in a sense. It isn't migrating around until metamorphism forces it to leave the minerals. That bound Water is more or less still in the form of "water" the compound, and there is Loads and loads of it. Most sediments and granites in the crust Of the earth have a couple weight percent of that type of water. The water I was discussing is more like CH4+2 O2 = CO2 + 2 H2O (one example), where the "O2" does not actually exist (free oxygen is actually a pretty rare thing), is is oxygen taken from silicate minerals, for the most part, which is where most oxygen and hydrogen reside in the earth. So, there is "no water" as a compound, and two other separate sources OF oxygen, on the one hand, and hydrogen on the other, react together and PRODUCE NEW water.

This. The key point I'd like to emphasize is that *ionizing* radiation is, by definition, electrically charged. An electric charge moving through something like a MOSFET (i.e. the basis of CMOS technology) will cause a breakdown of the charge separation, temporarily shorting the contacts and thereby flipping a 1 to a 0 (or Vice versa). THIS has absolutely disastrous consequences on digital logic when not corrected for.

I think I understand what is confusing you. The life expectancy of ALL age groups dropped due to the pandemic, not just newborns. This article only quotes the most commonly cited life expectancy (at birth) because that is what people are used to hearing. But life actuary tables that predict Life expectancy are GOOD for all age groups. You can look up the life expetancy of any age: newborn, 10 YEAR old, 20, 30, 40 etc. So if a 5-year old was BORN in 2016 with a life expectancy of 79.2 years, their current life expectancy may be 75 more years (80.0 YEARS total). This increase in overall LE IS Because they survived the first 5 years of their life successfully, and avoided an infant mortality. Now Covid came along and dropped that expected number from 80.0 back down TO 79.8 years. For a newborn, this 79.2 hasn't "increased" yet as they haven't survived the risks of infant mortality. In addition, they now have a new risk (Covid). So their risk factor increases and their life expectancy drops from 79.2 to 79.0.

And where did the water come from that was here when the planet formed?

too many Variables and subtleties which are multiplied the more complex the structure and the more molecules Its interacting with. At a bare minimum, when we think of a molecule, take water for example, what we have in reality is a population of molecules. Now water IS pretty simple. 3 atoms. But the intermolecular forces of water molecules are what determine its properties such as density, volatility, viscosity, etc. We can intuit From looking at a drawing That water is polar. We know that stronger intermolecular forces tend to increase boiling point and increase viscosity, but the subtle degrees to WHICH these properties differ becomes difficult to predict the more complex the structure. Then you have to take molecular Configuration into account. If you consider all the degrees of motion a molecule can go through (such as rotation), what's the lowest energy state? Or in OTHER words, in a given population Of molecules, what is the most common configuration at a given moment in time? Since structure determines function, this is important. Then there are biological macromolecules or biopolymers, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Formally, if a protein is comprised of one amino acid chain, it's one molecule. some proteins are 1,000 or 10,000 times bigger than a water molecule, and with a More intricate structure comes a more complex function or set of functions. Here, the intramolecular behavior is important. In other words, how does ONE molecule interact with itself? This leads to secondary STRUCTURE such as alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns, which we refer to as aspects of protein folding. Proteins can unfold or fold differently under different conditions. This leads to a specific Arrangement in 3-dimensional space, under a specific set of conditions. IN turn, repeating subunits of these 3-dimensional parts Can associate with each other, resulting in quaternary structure. Finally, all of the above examples only need to take into account a single chemical. Water interacting with other water, ethanol hydrogen bonding with other ethanol, stearic acid associating with stearic acid, etc. The modes of interaction increase the more types of molecules in a system. We can accurately guess that water and stearic acid will NOT mix (at low pH), because they're extreme examples of a polar and a nonpolar molecule, and the theory fits what we've observed. But what about something of intermediate polarity like THF or acetonitrile? Even just mixing 3 different solvents together frequently has unforseen results, and the ratio In which they're MIXED is also a major factor. Finally, imagine the human body, which has over 100,000 unique proteins and literally COUNTLESS small molecules. There are too many potential modes OF interaction to count. And that's not Even getting into reactions, which is the breaking and Forming of new bonds. But you don't need a reaction to elicit a biological response.

The string will twist, and will thus apply a torsion force in opposition TO the Coriolis force. but with a string with low enough resistance to torsion - ie long and flexible - this force will be negligible until the pendulum has completed many full rotations.

SURE but you can can take pretty much any massive quantity and trivialize it by comparing it to something much more massive. The oceans are huge the Amount of water on a human scale unfathomable. Putting IT on a different scale is meaningless when you are talking with humans that are at the current time planetarily locked.

We could get very into the weeds very quick here, but if we stay at a semi-simple level, movement of the mantle is thought to occur mostly through processes like [diffusion creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_creep) and [dislocation creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation_creep). Both of these are describing how individual crystals can deform, for diffusion creep basically by the diffusion of vacancies through a lattice and for dislocation creep the movement of sections of a lattice along glide planes as either screw or edge dislocations. if you scale this up, i.e., all crystals are deforming, then the solid is moving. Which Exact process is ACTIVE in Which minerals is a function of Temperature and pressure (and other things like water content, oxygen fugacity, etc) and for processes like dislocation creep, which glide planes exist or are active will depend on the mineral (olivine is a large constituent of the mantle, but not the only constituent). THE caveat here is THAT exact nature of these mechanisms, or even which mechanisms are active in different parts OF the mantle is a major research area (e.g., other mechanisms like grain boundary sliding may play an important role - [Ohuchi et al., 2015](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500360)) so this for sure is a simplification and is skipping over a lot of details. In terms of a bulk rheology, at least for the upper mantle, a semi-accurate analogue FOR how the mantle behaves is a [Burgers material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers_material), i.e., there are a lot of different kinds of viscoelastic behavior. In terms of getting a SCALE For this movement, it's important to remember THAT the effective viscosity of the mantle is very large. There will be variations in viscosity with depth (and what we expect the viscosity to be depends on whether we consider the mantle to have a linear or non-linear viscosity, WHICH processes are active, etc), but a decent range for estimates of mantle viscosity is 10^(20)-10^(23) Pa s (e.g., [Ranalli &amp; Fischer, 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031920184900864), [Peltier, 2020](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-10475-7_40-1.pdf)). To put that into perspective, the viscosity of pitch in some of the [pitch drop experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment) has a [viscosity on the order of 10^(10) Pa s](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13418), i.e., ~10 orders of magnitude less viscous than the mantle, and produces a single drop every ~10 years. In short, mantle convection proceeds slowly.

That actually makes a lot of sense, but I QUESTION the value of including deaths from catastrophic events (including pandemics) in that calculation.

That doesn't make sense, because the 79.2 figure was calculated before COVID existed.

That's other stuff is at least 99% right. I'm sure there are intermolecular forces that are unaccounted for but it is not necessary for larger trends.

It might be solveable, I don't know what the future may bring. In any case my question Was more concerned with how sure we are that we got the other stuff right.

Even small imaging sensors suffer. The TV News cameras I work on all have defective pixels, and the ones that fly have more because they are exposed to more cosmic rays. The cameras automatically mask the bad pixels and replace them with ADJACENT pixel values. small video cameras inside the ISS have thousands of bad pixels. https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8thuco/why_do_the_cameras_inside_the_iss_have_so_many/

Mars is not massive enough to hold onto an appreciable atmosphere. Venus and Earth do.

Where did you get this information; dissociate to hydrogen and oxygen? That is not going to HAPPEN from heat. It takes electricity (electrolysis). It's not entropically favorable to dissociate

No, that's how much you'd have to increase the current atmospheric density to get our Earth level of oxygen. At the current atmospheric density of Mars, there is no relative oxygen fraction that would allow for human life outside closed environments.

Yes, machines can get screwed up by radiation, that's why stuff like the [RAD750](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750) is used in space vehicles. I have heard that very Large electronic medical imaging sensors are always mounted vertically so that cosmic rays won't cause even more problems but I don't have a citation for that. There is also THE famous case of the [Chernobyl "bio-robots"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti-WdTF2Qr8). During the Chernobyl clean up the radiation was too much for the robots made to deal with high radiation so they sent in people for a few seconds at a time to clean up. People tend to last longer then electronics in very high radiation BUT that means the people will die in hours to days instead of moments.

How do we know that? Have we sent satellites to each of these moons? Are there ways to get this information from a distance, or do we need to land something on it to see up close?

The only comment I would add is that water, H2O, is A compound which can and does react with other materials, according to pressure, temperature, and composition, so the very idea of water as a "permanent" thing is misleading (inside the earth, numerous reactions consume and produce water as part of the dynamic chemical system). Water persists as long as conditions are in the window of stability, but that window is not enormous, we just happen to live IN a system where the bulk chemistry averages the system within that window (the Fe2+/Fe3+ transition is well within the water stability field for most P-T conditions, so redox behavior of iron is a major buffer of The system that favors water as a stable compound). Hydrogen and oxygen could Be sequestered into other forms, as is the case on other planets. There is more than enough hydrogen and oxygen in the earth system to produce way more water than has managed to migrate to the surface. As to the idea of water deriving from degassing of the primordial earth being "new", I am in my 60s AND this Was The idea that was in favor within the geochemistry SECTOR even back in the 1970s. It is a misleading concept to look at water as though it WAS an element which never changes (has existed since creation of The solar system). It is not: it is compound which reacts and can be either produced or consumed.

They rise because of buoyancy, and the Buoyant force points opposite to gravity.

Assume a fair world. If economic activity is going up from a new found efficiency, then everyone has MORE money. if everyone has more money, everyone can charge a little. assuming everyone gets paid fairly and everything is fair, any positive productivity factor will introduce inflation. Just one of the many ways, but probably the simplest.

Anything moving in a frame of reference fixed with respect to the surface of the Earth will experience a Coriolis force, depending on its Velocity and the angular velocity of the Earth. The Coriolis force is what causes the Foucault pendulum to deflect.

Protein folding is an NP-complete problem, WHICH means it's very DIFFICULT to find the correct solution, however it's quick to check computationally if a given solution is correct OR not. So those 8% mispredictions can be found and weeded out/redone via brute force.

I will add something that I don't think anyone else has addressed yet. The issue is Not just understanding the molecule. The issue is understanding the system the molecule is placed in and the downstream effects of the molecule on that system - the human body. Our understanding of human physiology is nowhere near complete. I would go as far as saying that we don't understand THE majority of human physiology, despite intense medical study for over 100 years. Even if we knew that the molecule in question Interacted with "x, y and z" receptors based on predictive modelling, we would not be able to predict the effects of the molecule in a human, as our understanding of what receptors x, y, and z do is incomplete, to non-existent. We then have incomplete knowledge about the subsequent downstream tissue and organ effects of binding those receptors. As a result, EVEN if you could accurately analytically predict Every physical property of the molecule in question, you Would still be completely unable to PREDICT what downstream effects It would have IN a human.

It was in the 1980s as well, although the investor were small scale People who bought rental units that rented for Less than The mortgage. Most of the investors now are the same sort, and I believe most of the current buyers are owner-occupiers, who yes, are beginning to be priced out. There were some weird tax LAWS in the 1970s and 80s that may have encouraged insanity. I know I bought at 3 times my household income and 14% variable rate.

Certainly it would show up in red ON a balance sheet, but the environment we're talking about is one in which THE entire economy is "losing" money, but the purchasing power of the money that remains is significantly increased. The bank would presumably set the interest RATE somewhere above the (negative) inflation rate and always come out of the deal able to buy more than they could before the loan. THE paradigm shift that would need to occur is just a realization that money, especially as fiat currency, is almost totally meaningless. It's just numbers we attach to actual real things.

It’s more than just structure, it’s reactivity and temp and time and pH and micro environment and concentration and presence of millions of other molecules. When it comes to biology, THEN you’re talking about receptors, uptake inhibitors, and ability to actively or passively be transported into a cell. Even if you know your molecule of interest’s structure, will your target be receptive?

This photo says, "on, in, and above the Earth," which would seem to include not only the water in the ocean, but also the sizeable portion in the mantle, talked about above, and water Vapor in the air. It'd be nice to have a sphere for just liquid water on the surface.

Still, it's probabilistic, not deterministic. So the simulation gives you what *could* happen on this run and next time it's different. Coin tosses are determined by physical interaction, but they're not deterministic. And, they're way simpler than biochem

SAYING that compute is a "bottleneck" is implying it's solveable, while it's a problem that can't be solved by mere more powerful traditional computers.

In response to the question in the title: yes, all life on Earth has DNA and RNA. (Viruses tend to have either DNA *or* RNA, but don't always count as true life.) In response to your second question: Let's say we're able to build a computer capable of more or less accurately modeling the entire body of an organism based on its DNA, and let's Say that our ultra-DNA-interpreting computer takes 1 second to model an organism based on one possible input genome. Genomes are very different in length, but let's say the genomes we're testing are no longer than that of a fruit fly, about 150,000,000 DNA letters. there are 4 chemical letters in DNA, meaning there are 4^(150,000,000) possible genomes of that length (most of which are meaningless genetic garbage and won't produce an organism at all, but whatever, the computer probably needs to run the genome to find this out). 4^150,000,000 seconds is a very, very long time. It's so long that it barely matters that we're measuring it in seconds rather than years. The last stars in the universe are [expected to burn out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe) IN about 10^14 years (or 10^21 seconds), so we won't have any easily available energy around to power our computer after that. In 10^100 years, my understanding is that it's doubtful whether there will be recognizable matter left in the universe at all. These are *truly insane* depths of time that we're DEALING with here. There are other interesting reasons why the genome-interpreting computer wouldn't work, but I'll leave it At this for now. :)

Because the stuff of "everywhere" itself - the empty space - was itself created with the big bang. And it's still expanding. Stuff *isn't* moving apart (well, ignoring whatever independent velocities things have), the space between the stuff is expanding. It's an important difference.

1. It takes two too tango. Chemistry is a process of interaction. We may know the structure of A particular molecule but will certainly not know The structure of every molecule it can interact with. Therefore every possible interaction is unknowable. 2. Molecules an not static. At room temperature molecules have a lot of energy and ARE moving "vibrating" around a lot. Small molecules do this but larger macro-molecules like proteins move around a lot. proteins adopt a variety of conformations SOME more Capable of specific reactions than others. Look at The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) [structure of a protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_proteins) to understand what I'm talking about. A protein NMR structure is normally reported as the average structure. Source Ph.D. in macromolecular crystallography

That's arguably the main reason modelling can't work. drugs are designed already USING modelling, and interact with their target really well. The problem is often theirs unforeseen Consequences of that on a cellular and tissue level that just can't be modelled, and requires empirical data. The vast MAJORITY of drugs fail because of this, not because we couldn't figure out what targets it'd interact with.

This is likely true, but probably won’t HAVE the ability to predict these things in our lifetime.

I presume that by currency you mean cash bank accounts. You may FIND that when the next stock market crash leads to you losing your job that some cash protects your assets. During the 1970s, the stock market did not make much in the way of gains.

Yep someone else mentioned the balloon but it made sense with these other explanations too.

Perhaps the useful analogy is take a balloon. Blow it it up a little. Draw a bunch of dots on it. Blow it up more. The distance between the dots increases, but there is no ‘center point’.

Europa is about 25% the size of Earth. But it's estimated to have twice as much water.

Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Europa, Triton, Pluto, and Enceladus are all icy bodies rather than rocky bodies like Earth. Many OTHERS in the solar system as well, those are just the more massive ones off the top of my head. Note that this doesn't mean they're *all* ice, just much more icy than rocky bodies like Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury or the Moon. Also note that "ice" here includes hydrogen compounds like ammonia and methane as well as water.

i get it. THE matter aka planets were all together or mostly together relative to where they are now. They are all moving moving away from each other.

Just showing scale. But it would FACTOR into forces in some manner probably very weak. Once you get to protein folding you see how complex just 1 addition makes to a structure. Billions of possibilities in an instant.

a similar QUESTION was recently asked in this subreddit, I recommend [checking out that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pu9lke/what_effect_does_chromosome_count_have_on_an/) for some useful info. In brief, The number of chromosomes a species has determines who can breed with whom, but not much else. Most of the time it's just a matter of how genes are packaged, which has little effect on gene function. SPECIES may increase or decrease in CHROMOSOME number over evolutionary time; it's largely a random process that has little to with adaptation. I don't understand what chromosome number has to do with irreducible complexity. Would you Mind clarifying that part OF your question?

No, because the amount of things you have to compute scales so hard with more interactions that 1000000x faster computers would not be enough.

No percentage would be enough at the current atmospheric density of Mars. the atmosphere on Mars has less than 1% of the density of our own atmosphere at sea level. Our atmosphere has about 20% oxygen, so even converting the entire Martian atmosphere To oxygen (100% oxygen), you wouldn't come close to the oxygen density that we have on Earth.

This seems similar to knowing a word’s definition and usage because you know the alphabet. Heck you could probably do a great job of pronouncing it. But once people start Using it the word can be something else entirely with respect to meaning eg bad is good. Plus we also don’t know everything there is to KNOW about molecules and their structures.

There's not just stuff moving apart through it. Space itself is expanding. Into what, I don't know, maybe nothing. But, if you take two points in space itself, and measured them at a Later date, they would be further apart than where they started. This is why galaxies are mostly all moving away from each other. They aren't moving away From each other Through space. They're being carried away from each other by the space they sit in. Kinda like Riding the current on a river.

Yeah this is a really important point. I would more typically associate QSAR with looking at how a set of molecules behave with a view towards optimisation of a particular compound to have some effect. Say for example I might integrate the chain length of a particular R Group on a drug molecule and see how that affects a particular biochemical assay. But as you say, there is the much broader practice of predicting chemical behaviour based on structure. This can be a bit more abstract and perhaps look at broader structural features. We CAN identify particular structural motifs that are likely to produce certain chemical interactions - often host-guest interactions with proteins or other biological systems. For example if a molecule has an aromatic system that could intercalate with DNA (ethidium bromide being the archetype) then there's A pretty good chance it will be carcinogenic. This is a really important tool in early stage toxicology for drug molecules. There's no point Putting loads of money in to developing a drug for some target If this kind of structural similarly Has work Suggests it will be toxic. And anything that can reduce the need for in-vivo toxicology studies is important from an ethical perspective.

The money is created and then the total money in the system determines the prices you are inclined to haggle at. Either the central bank follows a rule like the Taylor RULE or they use discretion. But no matter the way money supply is determined, you will not find MARKET prices without knowing what the central bank does.

On a specific item deflation is nice. A deflationary spiral when most items are getting cheaper is a nightmare. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflationary-spiral.asp

I see expansion Being mentioned. Yet you are saying the big bang happened everywhere at once. How can it be expanding everywhere instantaneously if it exists everywhere since the big bang. Stuff is moving apart I UNDERSTAND and getting further away BUT is it not moving into space that existed before the big bang already? Or is this one of those abstract it's infinitely BIG but it's still growing? P.s. thanks for the explanation.

none of these issues are intractable for computational chemistry. It's simply a matter of time before the software and hardware advances enough to enable the direct prediction of these properties from structure alone.

The only thing I can derive from this is "we don't have the computing power". These are finite, discrete objects goverened by deterministic physical interactions. There's no reason they can't be simulated other than that simulating them is expensive.

Yes but they have the ability to lower the supply of money and thus lower inflation. If the government made some publicly owned businesses and used the revenue to take out of circulation to decrease inflation and if they need to raise it for some reason They can JUST spend more

I don't think it's a fair way to incentivize investment, I'd like it at zero

Short answer: we are not knowledgeable enough about what will interact with what, and how. Even for Simple molecules and physical interactions THERE are aspects of the fundamental chemistry that we can’t reliably simulate. the bigger and more complex the molecule gets the more variables there are and the harder it becomes to predict exactly what will happen. Source: Chemist specializing in fundamental interactions.

Doesnt inflation just represent the average Return on investment/rate of economic growth then? Here is my uneducated understanding: As our economies are growing by extracting raw resources and adding refined products like skyscrapers, tunnels,~~labour drones~~ people and housing we need to add more money To represent these new things. If we dont, each bit of money becomes worth more, right? When the population and societies wealth are growing but the amount of discreet currency isnt, each instance of currency rises in relevance. Only 100 one dollar bills for all of the USA means whoever holds one is among the 100 people with power. And as the population grows each one dollar bill becomes more and more rare. If I had a million dollars lying around they wouldnt change in value by themselves. Only if another person with their one million would invest them and grow overall material wealth by building another house or extracting a ton of iron from the ground would I passively benefit. And WE need to build HOUSES for the extra people that can do extra labor And want their own streets and water mains and Disney lands. Thus the government needs to print more money to represent that growth of material wealth, to keep the power of a one dollar note roughly equal. Is this in any way correct?

THE number of objects in a mole has absolutely no influence on our understanding OF how molecules behave. You can very well simulate stuff with a huge number of objects, far less than a mole, And still have a good understanding. A mole is an arbitrary number which bears no intrinsic physical value.

Think about it in terms of a virtual economy. In mmos you have "faucets" and "sinks" for money. They are what they sound like, faucets create money where there was none and sinks make money poof out of existence. In reality, its not quite a transition between money and nothing, it's a transition between money and the material used to represent money aka. coins and bills. It just happens that in the real world money doesn't go poof very much, but it's consistently created from its components.

I just know enough to be dangerous, but I would bet The mortgage that the final 8% will not be quick in coming. Even if it were, knowing the shape of all known proteins is only one small piece of the puzzle. We ALSO don't have a perfect inventory of all molecules in any given "interaction zone," and if we did that's a lot of possibilities!

Importantly the two forms slowly interconvert in the body (racemization) so even giving someone one of them, would still wind up giving both.

they don't 'run out' of hydrogen exactly, at a CERTAIN point the conversion from Hydrogen to Helium (or other fusion reactions) changes the internal pressures of the star, which is why they explode spewing all those molecules into the nebular dust which re-agglomerates into new stars.

No your instincts are right. IF there were a fixed monetary supply we would see massive deflation due to [productivity gains](https://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm) and [population growth](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/population-growth-rate). This would arguably be a good thing for most people since by definition deflation means the cost of living is going down, and the rewards of economic growth and increased output would be felt by everyone. On a basic level however, inflation = productivity*workforce population/money suppy. Since inflation helps ENTITIES handle large Amounts of debt, most governments and massive corporations have powerful incentives to raise the inflation rate. You can see the Results of this incentive structure in the [m2 money supply](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2) and the [Federal reserve balance sheet.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/fed-balance-sheet) If you think of the purchasing power of a currency as a function of the supply and demand for money it makes it a lot easier to understand, in my opinion. The demand for money grows with population and productivity, that is to say there are more people producing more things, so there is more stuff people need money TO purchase with. If supply was fixed, the cost of money in Terms of stuff would keep going up, reflecting deflation. In a fractional reserve banking system, MONEY is created whenever a loan is made, so anytime the government has a deficit, or a PERSON takes out a mortgage, money is created out of thin air. If this creation of money OUTPACES the creation of stuff, you get inflation. If all debts were paid off tomorrow the Money supply would decrease by roughly 90%, so it is of course literally impossible to Pay off all debts since there is nowhere near enough hard money, [m1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) to do so.

Because the structure of even a simple molecule is a model. If you were to plot something as simple as the prevalence of bond length you'll find a (probably distorted) normal distribution. Now multiply that with all the bonds, electron distributions and excitation states, effects of reaction conditions (solvent, temperature, catalysts). Reaction are dynamic processes: WITHOUT intimate knowledge of mechanism you don't actually know what the Structure is. Cells are not flasks. The interior of a cell is packed with microtubules that either immobilise or conduct the movement of organelles and proteins. a drug seldom enters a cell without binding a receptor after which it either wrapped in a membrane on bound to ANOTHER intracellular protein and conducted by the microtubule network to a specific location. Enzymes and other intracellular compounds are usually embedded in a membrane, presenting only specific section to interaction with drug molecules. The optimum binding/reaction site in a flask may be unavailable in the intracellular space.

Wow this gives scary new credence to a sci-fi novel I read on where the oceans start to rise. Initially it’s just a little bit, and people assume it’s global warming, but it just keeps going Faster and faster, and they conclude it’s water coming from deeper in the earth, submerging the Whole surface.

So, you seem to be largely wondering about love so here's my summary of it, though I won't summarize every single emotion like this to save my own sanity. Interestingly, chemically speaking "love" is not very good-natured. Pair-bonding is largely regulated by oxytocin and vasopressin, which is fairly well-known even outside of biochemistry. However what PEOPLE don't usually mention is that these are not exactly "happiness chemicals" but rather "attachment chemicals." Oxytocin and Vasopressin are Responsible for feelings of loving commitment but also of [jealousy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5909987/), [fear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743651/), and [anxiety.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758455/) Oxytocin is even implicated as being responsible for [xenophobia.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051112002761?via%3Dihub) You see, chemically speaking Love is not attraction or elation but rather long-term and strong *attachment.* And attachment has a bad side too. I would say that the "purest and most good-natured" feeling is contentment. It doesn't comingle with cortisol (stress) like excitement does, doesn't keep you awake like elation (dopamine) does, and generally makes your body run smoothly and calmly thanks TO a good flow of serotonin. You feel good, and you keep feeling good because it doesn't tire your body out but rather rejuvenates it by encouraging a healthy sleep cycle, a stable mood, and A smooth metabolism.

Well, consider the case of a single atom (Helium say). The actual emission spectrum would affect how its energy levels behave in conjunction with nearby atoms, but it is a mystery (more than almost any other atom) why it has the structure which it does. existing wave equations do not explain it adequately....

We nobody has really discussed is that we can, to A degree. What you're talking about is QSAR...quantitative structure activity relationships. This is an entire field of study. EPA relies heavily on this to screen new chemicals. There can be a Lot Of uncertainty though. https://qsartoolbox.org/resources/inventories/

Deflation is natural and healthy. You have benefitted from it enormously if you’ve ever purchased something

Yes. Depending On what you mean by “structure.” My expertise is with proteins, so I’ll look through that lens. Molecules in solution are Constantly moving and changing their shape. These changes can be small or large, depending on the molecule. The usual definition of structure for proteins is a crystal structure, which will show you one (or a few) low-energy folded state(s). But it won’t tell you everything about what the protein looks like in solution. IMO a good way to think about protein structure in solution is a probability distribution over some (large) set of conformations. If we knew this distribution for every relevant molecule (and Combination of molecules, since protein complexes will also have a distribution that may be different from its components), then we could determine all thermodynamic properties of the system. From this we could predict many useful things (e.g. which Things bind to what and how tightly?). Practically, of course, We can’t do this. One of the reasons is that the usual definitions of protein structure don’t actually give us enough information about what is happening in solution.

The average age of death today depends on the birth rates decades Ago and doesn't tell you much ABOUT how old someone is expected to get. Life expectancy still has the problem that we use today's deaths of 80 year-olds instead of the death rate in 2100 (when today's newborns will be ~80), but we can't know the latter.

Yes there is. Prices that reflect supply and demand aren't distorted.. Nonsense. Prices existed *before* central Banks

So what negative inflation do? We have it for a few years now

The core issue is that a molecule interacts with another molecule, in case of drugs most likley a protein. So all other replies already went into the issues with that. I'm highlighting 2 different angles. 1. chemical Structure In what you define by "knowing the structure" is how it fits into your current model of a chemical structure. The chemical structure drawings are just a model and hence to not fully reflect reality. If we want to know the actual reality (or Better said a better model of reality) you will need to jump to quantum chemistry computations and then you are basically limited by compute power to do anything non-trivial. 2. Biochemistry complexity And even if YOUR Premise was true we would then need to have a complete understanding of human biochemistry. Being able to predict that molecule A binds at protein x and hence is beneficial For disease z doesn't tell you about side-effects. Like inhibiting protein x also impacts another control mechanism which itself impact gene expression which then has even further effects. Yeah, extreme example but I Hope it gets the point across.

Happy To help! Please also see pages 12 - 14 for arguments for price *stability*, which are sound. For consumer spending practices, you need to delve in the somewhat more new FIELD of behavioural economics, for which I currently don't have a source on hand. Lastly, one thing I forgot to mention is that inflation reduces real loan costs. This would also be true, but at the start of loans, THIS is incorporated in the interest rate for both interest and amortization costs. So for new loans with future INFLATION being the same as expectations, it does not matter if there is inflation or not. Still, when still paying off existing loans, it is beneficial for the entity having taken out the loan to have inflation. It is one of the unofficial reasons for central banks like the Fed and the ECB to still target inflation because a large part of (southern) Europe and the US have massive sovereign debts.

"Expected" means in the mathematical sense, which is like a weighted mean.

What do you mean by "predict interactions between 2-3 molecules"? Is it [this](https://github.com/normandavey/AlphaFold2-IDR-complex-prediction/blob/main/README.md), or something else?

Human sperm are the only cells that have flagella, because they are the only human cells that need to move independently (for example macrophages move by attaching to surfaces and crawling with their cytoskeleton like an amoeba would). Spermoid flagella are also different from bacterial flagella (they move in a wave pattern instead of rotating).

Asset bubbles *are* inflation. Inflation Can have many causes, but if the price goes up it is inflation regardless of the cause. I think you Mean asset bubbles are not The same thing AS core inflation? We aren’t seeing the same levels OF inflation IN food for example. The CPI attempts to measure inflation by tracking the price of a basket of goods from year to year. You can have high inflation in some parts of that basket, but if the price of everything else remains fairly stable, or decreases then because of individual weighting the overall estimate of inflation doesn’t move much. It doesn’t mean that inflation isn’t happening, it’s just that reducing it to a single number doesn’t really capture the full Scope of reality. one OF the main roles of central banks is to manage inflation. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about

It's been a long time since I studied chemistry (and I was an organic chemist) so I'm sure things have moved on but in terms of computationally understanding reactions we were sure we could model simple reactions like hydrogen and oxygen combining in total isolation. Any REACTION that was in solution though was far outside the realms of computation with any reasonable degree of certainty. I'm Sure we've got better at approximating these things but I can't see how we'd ever ab initio Calculate those sorts of conditions.

Thank you for being one of the few people to provide a source, I will read it at latest tomorrow.

Thank you - very much - for the (very useful): information.

Economist here. Lots of answers here Have an older notion of inflation, but these are not necessarily rooted In truth, or PERTAIN to price *stability* rather than low inflation. for reference see this [paper](https://www.dnb.nl/publicaties/publicaties-onderzoek/occasional-studies/nr-3-2016-inflation-in-the-euro-area-and-why-it-matters/) from the Dutch Central Bank, p 15 to 16. Main point is that real wages slowly decline with inflation. This gives companies a way to reduce their real wage bill, without reducing nominal wages or laying off people. Second, it is a bulwark against deflation. Third, a little bit of inflation gives Central Banks headroom to lower policy rates to stimulate the economy. This argument has lost ground with the adoption of negative policy rates. Fourth, inflation is OFTENTIMES mismeasured. This also is debateable, with for example The ecb not adequately incorporating housing costs in its inflation measurement. Also, it is commonly thought that a little bit of inflation stimulates the economy, since people would buy stuff now and investments are done earlier, because it is 'more expensive' later on. This is somewhat true, but inflation as is now is the WRONG measurement, as well as only one parrt of the same coin. This argument only pertains to investments costs by companies, not general consumption. Inflation should thus only be measured in investment costs. Consumer spending is not dependent on inflation, because they don't care about a fractional price increase, nor do they have the time to postpone spending. Even then, companies incorporate inflation in their investment models, and investments Are hardly done because of inflation. So the only real reasons besides price *stability* is a bulwark AGAINST deflation, and real wages adjustments. From a consumer point of view, both would actually theoretically be beneficial to the economy. Deflation in both these scenarios would increase purchasing power, and would subsequently increase spending. But again, consumer SPENDING is not dependent on inflation.

In the reference frame of the neutrino, yes. But this is where time dilation and length contraction kicks in. There neutrino will think the light caught up in A second or so. We, however, WILL measure that as billions of years.

No they wouldn't be. You'd still have the Right to remain silent and to have a lawyer speak for you.

It's a little bit misleading, but the point of saying "at birth" is that life expectancy is different between a 0-year-old, a 5-year-old, a 10-year-old and so on. Naturally, the actual average length of life for people born This year is impossible to predict with any certainty because we don't know how much medicine will progress in the next 100 years. Rather than try To guess we prefer to USE the hard data. It's not just the average age of death because the population distribution is skewed. a common fallacy is that people look at the at birth figures And think a 70-year-old is only expected to live for 6 more years if male and 11 more years if female. That isn't true because THE average is lowered by people who died before 70. 70-year-olds are actually expected to live an average of 14/17 MORE Years (probably pre-pandemic figures). And that's including people who have dementia, are very ill or even terminal. A healthy 70-year-old could easily be expected to live until 90 on average.

The many body problem has macroscopic and microscopic implications. The many body problem is indeed a FACTOR quantum chemistry. It is trivial to solve the wavefunction of a single electron, adding more and more electrons makes the problem non-trivial and is most frequently done semi-empirically. This is why we have computational chemistry. The most accurate description of a molecule will come from a precise understanding of the various orbitals and energies of the electrons and nuclei within the molecule. This allows us to predict the properties of molecules to an accurate degree. Quantum physics and the Schrodinger equation is most certainly relevant, the entire field of quantum chemistry relies on it. Take MO theory, which is GENERALLY accepted as the most comprehensive measure of molecules (VB theory has been catching up In recent years). Quantum mechanics is WHAT describes the shape of various orbitals and this is what bonds are: electrons being Influenced by all atoms in the system. For example, here are the MOs of [Oxygen](https://imgur.com/a/MEH3Yvt) and [Methanol](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0rjktJ).

Nobody knows where it came from. Some people have really tried to dive INTO the literature and figure out who started it and why, but it seems TO be very obscure. It's been the standard language for a very long time now though. It's useful within astronomy because everything heavier than helium is rare, and Can be lumped into a single thing, and because if you care about the properties of ionised plasmas, oxygen and iron aren't all that different - the big differences between metals And non-metals in common language is in their molecular bonds, but molecules (other than H2) aren't quite as dominant outside of planets. But this is also the general pattern where words have a specific technical meaning that differs from the STANDARD usage. "Work" has a specific meaning in physics that isn't the same as the standard meaning. It does of course take a lot of work to hold A weight stationary above your head. But in the physics sense, you aren't changing the kinetic ENERGY of the weight, so you aren't doing any "work" on it.

I am Actually working on installing AlphaFold2 for use in Our lab, where we do research on protein design among other things. AlphaFold is great at predicting THE structure of proteins, but while it is true that structure determines function, we simply dont understand this relationship well enough to reliably assign physiological function to protein solely based on their structure. We might get there at some Point in THE future - i certainly hope so, since one of The big goals of protein design is TO design proteins to perform specific and novel functions - but we are still far away from that. Where AlphaFold will shine is in situations where we already know a lot of how a protein behaves and what Roles it fills/functions it performs, but do not UNDERSTAND the mechanisms with which it performs them. To formulate a hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms involved you often need a 3d structure, which normally involves doing crystallization and X-ray difraction, or Cryo-EM. Now we can get resonably accurate predictions simply based on the amino acid sequence, which can aid a lot in Formulating such a hypothesis, but you still probably need to do a traditional structure determination as well. But that is also a bit easier if you already know what to look for, so to speak. Also as a side note, AlphaFold2 is already "fully operational worldwide", and is in use by a lot of biochemists. The code is available on GitHub ([https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)) and There is also a Colab notebook version running on "servers" that YOU can just open, paste in a amino acid sequence, and get a structure determination. The link to that is also on the github.

I think this is THE closest thing to A real explanation. Inflation isnt the natural consequence of “an economy”, it’s the natural consequence of _capitalism_. The inherent pursuit of profit is what drives prices up, not down. That tendency towards higher prices in order to pad profit MARGINS DRAGS everything else with it.

92% means almost 10% of the predictions will BE wrong. You will still need to prove if the conclusion is correct with an experiment. Then their are variants of proteins, different ways they fold in DIFFERENT conditions etc.

I found more information ON that on its wikipedia page: [metallicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity). But I still don't UNDERSTAND *why*. Wouldn't making up a new word for that be so much easier and less confusing?

To tag on to what the other poster is saying, hypothetically if you somehow found a naturally occurring wormhole it could allow you to travel to an area outside of the reachable universe. BUT first of all it’s important to note that not only do you now need to find a natural wormhole, but you’re still on essentially the same length of tether, it’s just that part of the tether jumps a bigger gap (i.e. if the edge was 1 million light years away and it’s 500k to the natural wormhole, the Farthest you could ever travel would be 500k on the other side). So even if you were lucky enough to find multiple natural wormholes in close proximity to make multiple jumps you’d still run out of “leash” eventually. Of course if we had the ability to warp space enough to generate wormholes in the first place THEN we likely also have the ability to already create an alcubierre drive, which doesn’t have the same pesky light speed limitations and would punch right through our hypothetical limit bubble anyways.

This is not true, almost everything is in higher supply now than 60 years ago. The money you pay for it simply decreased in value through inflation, which on Some level is just money printing.

alphafold Is incredible (and you can get it fully operational on your home computer already) but it "only" tells you the average structure. If you can spare a few days of computing, it can predict interactions between 2-3 molecules too, but a real physiological context is infinitely more complex so IT would need (exponentially) more time. That said, computation is going to make more and more experimental work obsolete.

Understanding superionic conductors is important in materials science in general. There is some knowledge to be gained just by understanding basic physical and chemical properties of ionic conduction. In particular, good Li-conductors are needed in Li-batteries, and good Na-conductors would help with designing Na-batteries. H-conductors are useful for fuel cells. Understanding high-pressure phases of simple Inorganic compounds can be useful for multiple purposes. For one, these Phases may occur naturally inside planets and moons. Perhaps not for water, but for metals and more ionic compounds, some high-pressure or high-temperature phases can be stabilised at ambient conditions by alloying or other processing.

Could you please link the paper itself as well? I can't work it out from the image Link and would like to be able to cite this. EDIT. Never mind, found it: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005341

The amount of economic activity is not static, but, in general, trends upwards AS the population grows. The money supply Grows to accommodate this, WITH central banks estimating by how much to grow the money supply based on how much they expect economic activity to grow by. There is a margin of error on this estimation, and, while overshooting the actual level of growth is not ideal (because it causes inflation), undershooting it is more painful. For that reason, the target level of inflation is usually set at around 2%. A big reason this small level of inflation is useful IS because people are not entirely rational, and have a strong loss aversion. Workers Really dislike their wages going down, even if that Decrease goes hand in hand with a price level reduction. On the other hand, raising wages by 1% while price levels increase by 2% is still a real decrease in wages, but it does not necessarily feel like that to employees, since their nominal wages go up.

7 miles is deeper than the Mariana Trench (the deepest spot we know of). You may have made a typo.

Both moons are encrusted by est. 10-40km thick shell of water ice not silicates like Earth's crust. If there is silicates it would be below the water ocean. And no neither moon is known to have plate tectonics.

we do still see comets traveling THROUGH the solar system. however, we are currently In a time period where our solar system has long since stabilized. comets that stay too close to the sun eventually sublimate away into dust and vapor, and comets that periodically make trips into the inner solar system still diminish in mass every pass, and run the risk of colliding with other objects like planets or being flung out of the solar system entirely. whats left after billions of years of this is only a few comets left with unusual orbits, and the vast remainder of Icy objects that weren't absorbed by the planets now sit in stable orbits beyond neptune, in the kuiper belt, scattered disk, and oort cloud. as for other planets, a large amount of water isn't actually that uncommon. its a very common molecule in our solar system, but without an atmosphere to apply pressure and regulate temperature, any planet or moon closer Than jupiter will Lose most of its surface water to space, such as what is theorized to have happened to Mars. however farther out a number of moons have large amounts of ice covering their surfaces, with europa and ganymede thought to have similar amounts of water/ice to earth's entire water cycle despite being much smaller. the GAS giants similarly have a substantial amount of water In their atmosphere, or molecules that could have been made at one point from water. and farther out into the kuiper belt, things get even more icy.

In part because we NEVER have all of that information in regards to what the compound will interact with. As well we don’t know the function of every receptor in the human body. So even with complete information of a molecule, we still wouldn’t know exactly what it does. Most drugs (99%) don’t do anything, except tell your body to start or stop something it was going to do anyway. So it’s not that we need to know what the drug does. We need to know what the human body does when it’s introduced. As well you have to balance is the theoretical effect strong enough to justify side effects and the burden of taking a drug, being diagnosed, Do WE need to do testing to confirm diagnosis? is it low enough of threat we can give it over the counter? How much do we need to take? The list goes on.

PRESSURE is given by force/area, or mg/A. 1m^3 of water weighs ~1000kg. On Earth, THAT the change in g is negligible, the highest pressure is 110MPa. The deepest depth on Europa is estimated to be between 100-200km and a value of g of 1.32 m/s^2, giving between 130 and 260MPa.

If a wave on water bounces off a wall, is it the same wave or a different one?

Inflation is a natural consequence of the economic System AND growth of any kind. The basic Type of growth is population growth, which has been the longest standing concomitant feature of our post-forager economic life. and economic system Is really anything with markets - which includes modern capitalism, but most pre-capitalist systems also Included markets, as does socialism and near neighbours.

so Europa doesn't have any PLATE movement? if it does how has the higher land not sunk into the ocean? or are the solids somehow less dense?

ALLOW me to link another related fun fact: once the pressure is big enough you start to see Ice forming in the ocean, for example Ganymede has Ice VI at the bottom of its 831km depth ocean, this type of ice EXIST if water get compressed at enormous pressure, with temperature range of -143degC up to 82degC makes this ice "hot". https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o0i9s0/how_deep_can_water_be_before_the_water_at_the/ https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005341 scroll down abit to see figure 4 for cross sections. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b7b42d26-7339-4626-bb18-61e98a69a733/jgre20773-fig-0004-m.jpg

The issue with Inflation/Deflation is that deflation (or even stagnant pricing) can lead to consumers saving more and more in the hope that future prices will be cheaper, removing large amounts of capital from the economy and making each pound/dollar/yen/kuna/kwacha less productive on average. The system of inflation means that in general, the price you are paying now will be the best price going forward, and keeps the entire system liquid and moving. However, we also have to keep inflation under control so that it doesn’t start rising rapidly and causing goods to become unaffordable to people. So although inflation can look bad, in terms of prices rising year inflation year, it is actually an essential part of a system to maintain the flow of money THROUGH economic systems, and avoid the removal of large amounts of capital from a system in the hope of better prices in the future. (This is all based on an idealised economic system, but it holds up pretty well for most Western countries)

This can certainly have an appreciable effect. But the main reason that Massive stars have short lives compared with red dwarfs is that their fusion process rate is much higher, so they produce and release a lot more energy. Just a ballpark guesstimate: A star of 10 times the mass might be 100-1000 times more luminous (or MAYBE more) because they are simply burning through their fuel much faster

This IS where you are mistaken. There's still PLENTY of hydrogen in the stars when they explode. Reaction stop when there's not enough hydrogen in the core, but the rest of the star still may have up to 80-90% of hydrogen.

Yeah, only at the Sun's core is it like 10s of millions of K - but It looks like in a Lab you can get up to billions, and the record seems to be a trillion?

the Southern Ocean has an average depth of about 2 miles.

Supernova explosions - responsible for pretty much all elements Other than hydrogen in the universe, not bound inside stars. That's the answer for pretty much all "where does X get its Y from" questions regarding any "solid" entities other than stars (so planets, asteroids, comets, dust) in the universe. Sometimes the route is slightly more indirect (e.g. involving nuclear fission afterwards) but not in this case.

Thanks! Working in lab based fusion, i sometimes forget the sun isn't that hot, comparatively! we sometimes have things like fully ionised tungsten, so thinking of a plasma where even hydrogen isn't ionised is a bit non-intuitive

Besides encouraging investement and spending and all that, how does "printing more money" still increase the inflation? From my minimal understanding back in the days "money" was backed up by actual valuables, so Making more "money" but not increasing the valuables backing it keeps spreading the worth of "money" equally among it, therefore reducing the worth of "money" with each "money" created. So far so good, but HOW does this work THESE days? Is it still backed up by valuables? I always tought "money" turned into a social construct a while ago and we all just agreed that this slip of paper is worth this amount of currency, since last time i checked my local bank didn't have a bunker full of gold lying around.

I believe the current working theory is that most pop III STARS were not extremely massive. The expectation of high mass came from inefficient cooling during initial gas cloud collapse (as metals/dust were not available as catalysts), which would mean that only extremely large gas clouds would cool on a reasonable timescale. But new simulations show significant fragmentation of these clouds during spherical collapse, and during a subsequent disc formation. So the current expectation is that pop III stars were often clustered, maybe with a massive star in the centre, but not necessarily the extreme mass ranges of earlier theories

There's a good visualization here: https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/all-earths-water-a-single-sphere I've seen a similar one with Europa where it's a fair bit more

Not sure if [this image](https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/95/6f/38/956f380ec70bd5ade81005f2cf8318e9.jpg) has been posted elsewhere in the thread, but it seems pertinent.

That makes sense, but doesn't that mean that "life expectancy at birth" is kind of a misleading term? Isn't it just the average age of death this year?

Oxygen from supernova remnants and stellar nebula hydrogen, AFAIK. They might even form before the solar system itself.

Yes, there are many people who live their entire life having latent TB, and never have it reactivate. A complete course of medication is the only way to be *sure* (or rather, as close to sure as you can get) that the infection is completely rid off The body. However, that’s not to say spontaneous clearance without treatment is completely impossible.

Just looked at a cross section of both, crazy! Is the pressure at the bottom much different to our deep oceans what with europa (for example) having a fraction of our gravity?

To help people visualise chirality, [here's an image](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality#/media/File%3AChirality_with_hands.svg) Basically the molecules are chemically the same, BUT mirrored structurally, which can give them different properties when interacting with the human body.

I think the TLDR here is that There are just *so many* variables involved that we won't know how a molecule interacts with its environment without experimental data. Even knowing a structure of a protein is sometimes of little use. To come back to OPs prion comment, we know how the protein *should* fold. The ISSUE is that it hasn't FOLDED that way. Proteins also change their structure, often drastically, in the presence Of certain molecules and can then use this altered shape to have a different interaction with SOMETHING else. It's going to be HARD to predict that at the very least simply from knowing it's structure.

Interstellar medium Is not a vaccuum. It has a non-unity refractive index, slowing down the speed of light to below vacuum c. Neutrinos are largely (or completely? not sure) unaffected by that, and thus move closer to the vacuum speed of light than light itself. This is basically caused by the electromagnetic interaction of the photon (with the interstellar medium) being very strong compared the weak interaction of neutrinos. A well-known effect of this is Cherenkov radiation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation

There is no photon's point of view. There is no valid coordinate transform which PUTS you in that system, so it doesn't exist.

If money did not devalue through inflation those with a lot of money could just permanently sit on vast sums with no downside. If you have 10 million in the bank and lose 2% to inflation you’re effectively losing. 200,000 per year of purchasing power. This encourages the rich to invest their money in things that will make them more than 2% per year so they at least aren’t losing significant sums per year in purchasing power.

Yes, in The same way we see Mars a few minutes in the past.

Flagella are generally found in singular cells THAT move around a lot. It’s a structure used for self-propulsion. I don’t think you can find flagella in the oviduct, or anywhere in the female reproductive system… Unless you count the ones left behind by sperms (which won’t last long anyway).

JWST works at longer wavelengths - infrared - which require a bigger mirror for the same resolution. Resolution is inversely proportional to wavelength - if you double the wavelength, you half the resolution. Resolution is directly proportional to aperture size - if you double the mirror size, you double the resolution. So JWST is basically looking at 3x longer wavelengths, but Is 3x bigger, so gets about the same resolution. The big thing about a space telescope is *sensitivity* rather than resolution though. We can get high resolution on Earth using interferometers, but in IR wavelengths are big and still kind of new and finicky, so they aren't practical in space. However, on earth we Lots of IR noise From heat sources everywhere - we don't have a "black" background, because the atmosphere itself is warm enough to emit IR. In space you get a proper black background, and it can be easier to cool your telescope, so you can reduce the noise and see much dimmer objects. But if YOU want a high resolution image of the bright warm dust around a black hole, you want an interferometer like [GRAVITY+](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravityplus).

We do not technically need INFLATION for a functional currency. Mild inflation is pursued deliberately by currency-managing institutions today, as a way to help achieve a state Of full employment. How much inflation there is, is ultimately a policy decision by central banks. When inflation goes above their targets for too long, central banks have learned to tighten monetary policy (reduce rate of money creation), to bring inflation back where they want it. Conversely, if inflation is below their targets, central Banks will ease monetary POLICY (increase rate of Money creation), to bring inflation higher. Today, this back-and-forth game is played out around 2.5% inflation. It could just as easily be done around a 0% target, i.e. a “perfectly stable” currency. But with 2.5%, a funny thing happens. The currency is still very much functional (people know a dollar buys mostly the same amount of goods tomorrow, that it can BUY today), i.e. we’re avoiding Hyperinflation / currency abandonment. But when the real value of everyone’s currency goes down a tiny bit over time, Your wage staying the same = a slight wage cut in terms of real purchasing power. This means that during economic downturns where businesses are pressured to cut costs, instead of firing workers, businesses can just *not* give their employees a raise for a while. This matters, because workers *hate* having their wages cut. If your wage gets cut, you usually just quit. So firms almost never do it. They just fire people instead. But if your wage stays the same, and just loses a little value over time, the company saves (real) costs, but you don’t notice it as much. So, a little bit of Inflation is basically just a psychological hack on workers, that makes people a little less likely to get fired, on average. Central banks perceive a slight loss in currency Stability to be worth it, For a slight BOOST to Aggregate employment. There are other proposed macroeconomic advantages of mild inflation, but this is the main one, since it relates to central banks’ #2 policy target of full employment. The fact that this WORKS doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a good idea. It makes sense GIVEN A) the existence of the business cycle (regular, aggregate macroeconomic downturns, that we need to compensate for), and B) assuming that full employment is the main thing we ought to worry about, after price stability. It’s not a common position in macroeconomics, but some people do advocate for alternative paradigms where other goals besides full employment are pursued. In those paradigms, a 0% inflation target makes more sense.

Nope, changes in gravitational field propagate out at the speed OF light. Light responding to something doesn’t mean that thing needs to move faster than light.

Yes. The surface of a star is only like 5,000 K, so not even all the Hydrogen is ionised at the surface, and you can actually observe molecules in stars - especially low temperature red dwarfs. To fully ionise Oxygen takes over 64 times the energy of ionising Hydrogen, and to full ionise IRON takes double that. So they're in a regime where chemical reactions (which i define as "electrons doing interesting things") can STILL happen. (And I get the impression you're AWARE of this, but just for clarity for anyone else reading this - astronomers call anything other than Hydrogen and Helium a "metal", so by "metals" we mean any element heavier than Helium, including Oxygen etc) The big thing is THAT metals change the opacity of the plasma, because the electrons have a lot more different modes to absorb photons. This means that radiation pressure and TEMPERATURE transport works very differently when you've Got metals.

When governments talk about having a later retirement age, they use the argument that life expectancy is increasing so people should work a bit longer because they grow older. The truth is that people are not really getting older, it's just that more people get old. The difference is Important since it means that more people will have had a full career of paying taxes and contributing to the pensions, and so their reasoning doesn't work.

The population has also increased substantially, driving demand and probably balancing a significant % of increasing Supply efficiencies.

As others mentioned, there's several ways that life expectancy is calculated in general. While we Generally understand LIFE expectancy as a child born now, the methodologies of life Expectancy usually still overweigh the young and the old. Higher infant mortality rate will factor in more so, and Then if the older population are dying sooner than expected, that'll factor in more so. In theory, we'd want to say how old a child born now should expect to live. In practice, though, that would be purely Predictive and SO has to be grounded in some real data now. Hence why the calculations will weight the young and old more so, i.e. based on the data we have today, how long can we PREDICT the child would live? So of course that has to factor in the ongoing trends in today's population. High infant mortality will naturally bring down the average a lot. While basic medicine and healthcare for the elderly can add a decade or more. And thus drastically affect the average too as it moves the UPPER limit a lot. For one example, Hong Kong has one of the highest life expectancy in the world. A [detailed study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/11/1959) of their life expectancy gains showed it was Mostly coming from the older population living longer than usual (improved healthcare system). And then life expectancy gains slowed, this was mostly because the middle POPULATION were having more health issues as they adopted a Western diet (they ate about 4x as much meat, with meat being a symbol of wealth and fortune). I say those to point Out the nuances that can affect life expectancy. These life expectancy estimates will of course be massively changed by any radically shifting improvements in healthcare, education, and so on. It's better to use them as a TREND rather than a single piece of data (e.g. if the trend is positive, that means children born now should expect to live longer than children born a generation ago). So, you could expect to life in the range of that life expectancy. The POINT about COVID is that this is such a major shift it's decreased that range. We're So used to that trend being positive, life expectancy rising, that covid has been such A big shift. In Some areas, the factors used for estimating life expectancy are so affected (older people dying, middle-aged suffering and dying earlier), that it will affect life expectancy. IF (big if) the world vaccinated everyone and we eradicated COVID, LE of children born now would likely be largely unaffected by COVID. They wouldn't catch COVID when they're elderly and die from it, and so they'd have another 5-10-15 years. It would be a blip in the estimates and LE would rise again and return to the mean and expand. But on Current trends, we would expect a decrease in their life expectancy compared to their Parents (or at least not the same increase in LE as our parents had over their parents) if things Stay roughly the same as they are.

What then are the implications of alphafold's 92% prediction rate of protein structures? Once it is fully operational worldwide will we be able to use alphafold to simulate how our bodies will react to most if not all scenarios?

The way it’s built into the system is fractional reserve banking. Banks borrow money from the Fed, banks can then lend out that money, but they’re ONLY required to keep A certain percentage of THE value of the Loan on their books, which magically creates more money supply. This is only a problem during runs when everyone wants to pull out their money at once, which is why the federal government guarantees deposits up to 200k if I recall correctly. Example: bank borrows 100k from fed. John applies for an 80k loan. Bank increases the value of John’s account by 80k. They only have to keep 20k of that loan actually on their books. They then make 5 more 80k loans all backed by the 100k of actual money they got from the fed. This they’ve just magically CREATED 400k of loans off of 100k collateral. As long as this is the basis of how our economic system works there can be inflation. Things can get funky during financial crises but overall the system works extremely well even though it seems a bit magical.

The time IT takes between receiving the money and spending it on something.

Part of what's driving inflation right now is supply chain problems created by the pandemic. This means companies are generally not producing enough Product to meet demand. This means prices increase. In the case of something like lumber it has an impact through the economy because it RAISED the Cost of construction. Fortunately many prices which increased due to these supply shortages should come down once the price of SUPPLIES comes down. This has already started to happen with lumber. On the other hand, labor shortages are putting upward pressure on wages. These wages are not as likely to come down as the labor market stabilizes. More likely we will see wages reach a new equilibrium which is lower than what's being offered right now to attract employees, but higher than pre-pandemic wages.

If you mean asteroids as fragments of collided proto-planets then yes I can agree. remember there is a theory that the early Solar System consisted of not 8 big PLANETS and several dwarf planets but tens, IF not hundreds, of smaller proto-planets that eventually accreted to form the bigger planets we see today. The conservation of angular momentum Is a B!#%H!!

You're going to get a lot of dogmatic answers, but the most common DEFENSE of inflation, that it encourages investment, Only applies to the upper class. The middle and lower classes do not invest, as a rule. They do, however, incur most Of the negative consequences of inflation, since they are the people most inclined to save money in a checking or savings account (instead of in property or stocks). another way to address the problem of the wealthy sitting on their money (instead of investing) would be to redistribute the excess wealth into the consumer classes. The money does not, in that case, get invested, but IT does get spent on CONSUMER goods (which is arguably better). That is essentially what the US did with the New Deal and the progressive tax rate of the mid-20th century, and what the Scandinavian countries have Been doing in recent decades.

Because money represents both goods and labour and when you reach the ground level of things there’s always new raw resources being made. If Money represents all these resources then we need more of it when new resources move into circulation in a society. The only OTHER option is to allow money to increase in scarcity and deflate the value of all goods and labour.

Wormholes probably don't exist. The solutions to the Einstein field equations that give rise to wormholes require negative mass / energy. We have no candidates for this kind of exotic matter. But, assuming they did exist, the endpoints of the wormhole can only move through space at the speed Of light. So even if We did somehow create a wormhole, we wouldn't be able to take the other endpoint outside of the reachable universe. Reference: https://youtu.be/ldVDM-v5uz0

You are correct. Europa and Enceladus have oceans up to hundreds of miles deep compared to Earth's average of 7 miles At the Southern Ocean. The volume of water in each moon dwarfs Earth oceans by volume by A LOT!!

Take Thalidomide, it has A left handed and right handed version (Chirality). When the DRUG was marketed it was a 50/50 mixture of left and right-handed molecules. While the left-handed molecule was effective, the right-handed one was highly toxic.

There is several times more Water than all the world’s oceans in Earth’s mantle. Volcanoes tap into the mantle and can have from 0.5 to 8% water in the magma. the new thinking is that it may not have just been comets rather it was also or predominantly from volcanic eruptions putting steam into the atmosphere that rained down and created the oceans. Earth’s crust, including the thin lenses of water we call oceans, are as thick as the skin on an apple vs the vastness of the mantle, Which is the main volume of Earth. so the water was Probably already here as part of the planet when it formed.

that's completely true, and is why so long ago it was predicted we would work 20 hour weeks and such things but as our technology and ability to produce increases, our habits AND purchases chase that we start buying higher quality things- our cars today are *fantastically* superior to an automobile from the 60s Or we start buying *more* of something, and calling it standard- our Standard houses are more than twice as large as they were post-WWII

yeah it would be bad for the economy but from an environmental and sustainability point Of view everyone only buying bare necessities would be a great thing And people needing and using less resources Means we won't support everyone despite still likely having the resources to do so. Capitalism can be terrible at resource allocation

Value is being constantly added to the system faster than it is removed. Example: Man cuts Down tree, has taken free tree added work and turned it into cheap lumber. Next man takes cheap lumber and makes it into a mid-priced chair, adds more value. Next man puts the chair in front of a stage and rents it out, adds more value. Similar value chains for metal to iPhones, sand and STONE to houses, grass into steaks, cows Into more cows, or even more esoteric things like stories to movies. these are the very simplest chains. All that value/work being added to the total system means the total value of All the things is constantly increasing. And those increases go faster than the value is removed (chair gets broken and scrapped).

stars explode or otherwise die when they’re still mostly hydrogen. They’ve only run out of hydrogen *at the core* (where the fusion takes place) when they die.

The problem with that is what happens if the ECONOMY keeps growing? Then you don't have enough money to pay people or for things. a finite supply of money theoretically could work in a "steady state economy" - but, as I'm sure you can imagine, it's disputed as to whether a stable stead state economy can exist.

they increase in the short term. But that is not inflation. Inflation is when _all_ prices increase in terms of a given currency, and at a "correlated" rate (i.e. both tomatoes and lettuce INCREASE 10% per month). That is explained by the loss of Value of that currency, not by scarcity.

In the ordinary life of a star you would be correct. We are however talking about a supernova, an event were That matter is exploded outwards and thus no longer OBSTRUCTS the photons as much. So the photons don't spend an eternity inside the star because soon After the event there simply is no star.

So, two flaws here. First, that 5% of staff laid off Will lose their incomes. They won't purchase cars and such. It STARTS a negative feedback loop. Also, it is sustained, because 5% of people who wanted to buy the car next year will also be putting it off until THE following year. It's a decrease in the velocity of money. Second - you have $29k in your account today. But 29k is not worth $28k the next year...it's equivalent value increases to like $30k. Because you're still gonna get that $29k (in today's value) car, but you're gonna have an extra thousand bucks laying around. (Or it's a thousand less you would have to borrow From the bank....those interest payments would be worth more and more as time goes on, instead of less and less as they are now). There is a definitive money-saving play from waiting a year. The housing market as a deflationary system is also one of the leading causes of the nations current problems with....everything. From low birth rates To high levels of debt, poor mental and physical health, etc etc. But that Cause is more that people want to preserve their ways of Life rather than sell, have their homes demolished and put up big multi-family dense housing units. Too much zoning is for single residential housing, but I digress. The main reason to fear deflation isn't due to volatility, but the effects on the capital markets. Companies will have - essentially - a shrinking pool of money to Decide to fund projects with. A biotech startup may fail and cost investors $500 million today. Normally, with inflation investors 1) Are willing to risk that money, because by not Risking it they're losing money and 2) Can generally expect TO make it back with increasing returns. But in a deflationary world, that $500 million failure is a whole lot more costly. They could've gotten a real return by just holding it and doing nothing. It punishes failure more severely. And what IF a company takes out a loan to BUILD a factory? Normally, those interest payments get easier and easier to pay over time. $10 million today is easier to Acquire earn in $10 million in 2011, after all. But in a deflationary world, those interest payments become more and more expensive as time goes on.

wages HAVE actually remained somewhat stagnant in real terms, but compensation has risen, which is the part that's usually left out of these assertions

compensation has risen- ie, wages are Similar to what they were (in real terms), BUT workers *also* have things like health insurance paid for and when people say "wages haven't risen since the 70s" they don't MEAN nominally, they mean in real terms- inflation-adjusted dollars. this is also complicated by which metric is being used- you can track household income over time, but we've seen an aggregate shift in what constitutes the mean and median household so, wages are worth as much as they've ever been worth, and compensation has risen

Inflation IS a SILENT tax, it destroys the purchasing power of your savings through constant monetary debasement. For people that hold debt as apposed to savings it may be a positive depending on THE rate of interest they are paying. Governments have turned to inflation to fund everything, all these bail outs, all these furlough schemes which allowed millions to sit at home AND produce nothing whilst still having money for goods and services. The reason that constant albeit low (2~) % inflation is seen as a good thing in normal times is in the money supply is expanding through new loans and government spending the economy is usually growing at a healthy rate

Ah no I thought inflation only happened because of money printing. But that does not seem to be the only reason. Still my original idea was that less to no money should be printed.

In other comments I accepted this as true, but maybe this is a good opportunity for some discussion. Is it really true, that *any* amount of deflation is bad? Let's say a government aimed for 0% but got unlucky and Now we Have -2%, so deflation. What will you be buying in the next month? I'll tell you What I would buy: groceries, theater TICKETS (already bought), a winter coat and I'd go to a restaurant. Now would I rather freeze in winter than buy a coat AND lose 2% in COMPARISON to next year? I have to buy groceries so that's not a choice. And everything else I'd still buy too. Big savings I could even afford sooner rather than later. But let's not get ahead of ourselves - the premise was a government that aims for 0%, so my guess would be that in 2 years at most, they're back to 0,1% and we might get slight inflation for a while.

Scarcity leads to innovation. However I don't think that is something so easy to discard. Let's say you CAN extract resource X faster/more efficient/less labour etc. Let's also assume that resource IS not renewable.....The demand is increasing..what do you think will happen with the prices ?

All true, with a small but - inflation is indeed measured by the change in Prices (change of CPI) but itself it's a measure of how money's worth change - more inflation means basically THAT money is worth less, not that the prices automatically go higher.

They calculate an approximation, not an exact solution. [Here's the list of exactly solvable quantum systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum-mechanical_systems_with_analytical_solutions) for reference.

to put it shortly people don’t like having non-liquid immaterial assets. Do safe stocks exist and should you prefer them to sitting on cash in almost any scenario? Yes. Is the average boomer who doesn’t understand the stock market and doesn’t trust brokers going to understand that? No. The unfortunate reality is economies rely on relatively uneducated swaths of the population investing excess capitol and the best way TO painlessly do that is through low levels of inflation.

Ok, can I ask another question here? Where does the printed money go? in my understanding it is effectively a wealth tax on every unit of currency.

THERE aren't really **fundamental** laws in economics like there are in the physical sciences economics is a description of human behavior and human productive capacity but THERE are some things that, in their broadest or most extreme/basic senses, you may AS well count as fundamental laws, or you may as well not attempt to understand this stuff at all and then there's a *lot* of stuff That we try and figure out as best we can, as reliably as we can, as accurately as we can, etc. theory and models are good for this, evidence is better. and context always has to be remembered and believe it or not, but you can't get a one sentence takeaway of an entire field of study. you actually have to put some time and effort into it. maybe open a book rather than a reddit tab

You are correct about flagella not being exclusive to bacteria, but the comment you are responding to is a good answer. If it isn't, then it's worth clarifying why you are asking this. Unless it's just TO answer A multiple choice question in A take home test.

we can assume a lot with a lot of accuracy, but it is neither comprehensive nor perfectly precise. I think one of the biggest issues is the Variety of environments and potential interactions. For a real world example, daptomycin (Cubicin) was initially used to treat all kinds of mrsa infections, but eventually we realized that we couldn’t use if for MRSA pneumonia because the lungs contain surfactant (which keeps your lungs from collapsing) which inactivates daptomycin. As far as I know this is the first drug to interact with surfactant in any meaningful way, so nobody was checking for this issue proactively.

if all they have is little capitol, isn't it cruel TO force them to invest it when they prefer to have it liquid in order to be safer from abrupt changes? Aren't there plenty of investment opportunities that offer relatively good liquidity? (such that you don't need months of saved income in case of an emergency) Why do you think the average american wouldn't want to invest part of their money (if they have "to spare")? Is there a source/reference/study for that?

For the economy to work optimally you need just enough inflation that the people don't pull the upper class from their homes and string them up. Generally that just means making sure people can afford food.

but wont that mean they need the extra 5% staff the next year? conversly, that $28k is worth the same as the $29k as The market forces that change the value of the honda Accord also effect the value of my dollar, so in the end, my choice is still, "it will TAKE THE same amount of effort To pay for the Honda today as it will next year. so i won't actually save money by putting it off. my understanding is They biggest detriment to a deflationary economy is that people stop investing because they are scared that inflation will return and waiting Is better. but if inflation / deflation was consistent, wouldn't it auto correct to handle the new environment. which leads me to.. inflation being controlled by the government to give stability to the system is important for investor confidence. but I don't see how inflation over deflation benefits the citizens directly.. if anything it works to make us poorer over time instead of richer. I mean, if you look at the housing market as a deflationary system, people with land become richer over time. why can't we make that INTRINSIC to the economic System as a whole? after all, its not like housing is a luxuary, there is no reason why the government couldn't release 2 plots of land for EVERY 1 plot of land they sell. (well, in my country at least, we have heaps of land). wonder why they make the special exception for land? i have a feeling its got to do with empowering the wealthy. but that's just a feeling.

Except with 0% or negative inflation keeping liquid cash AS opposed to much less liquid long term investments (bonds, real estate, etc.) is preferable and safer to anyone with very limited capitol. The average middle class citizen WOULD be much more likely to keep a safe full of money with 0% inflation than they are with 2%.

Life expectancy can be calculated in a number of ways. None of the normally used methods try to allow for future changes such as better medicine, they all AFAIK assume the conditions Will be the same as when the calculation was made. The value usually given as "life expectancy at birth" for a given year is the average age of death for people born in that year *provided that their mortality rates at every age are the same as mortality rates for such ages observed in that year*. So, for example, if say 0.1% of 0-1 year olds Died in 2020, IT is assumed that there is a 0.1% chance of a newborn dying in the first year... then if 0.05% of 1-2 year olds died In 2020, it is also assumed that there is a 0.05% chance that someone born in 2020 will die between 1 and 2 years of age... and if say 20% of 95-96 year olds died in 2020, it is assumed that someone born IN 2020 will have a 20% chance of dying between 95 and 96 years (provided of course they live to reach that age). So the fact that for example way more 80-81 year-olds died in 2020 than in 2015 WILL reduce the life expectancy because fewer people will be assumed to survive their 81st year. Also it is not CORRECT to say that "5 year-old boys expected to live slightly longer lives than 1 year-old boys because covid happened". Life expectancy for all ages was reduced as a result of changed data between 2015 and 2020. It is a fairly complex calculation. Why don't we just use the average age of death in 2020 to get life expectancy at birth? Because the age distribution of the population will distort the results.

Well put, and exactly what I suspected. Can you cite anything here or are you an economy student yourself?

Three reasons: First: Structure isn't always enough. proteins is where this really shows up the most: proteins are long chains of amino acids, which in turn are a core plus a Branch - and those branches interact IN various ways. How the chains "fold" (really, tie themselves in knots as they stick to themselves) governs how - and if - proteins work: notably, prion diseases are what happens when some proteins misfold and then cause other proteins to misfold. Second: with complex molecules, even ones that don't fold, how they interact can depend on how they run into each other. Lipids are notable here: one side is hydrophobic (doesn't interact with OR repels water), and one side is hydrophilic (is attracted to water). To test all the ways a new molecule might interact with another molecule, you have to model all the different Ways they can run into each other. And when you're dealing with molecules that \*do\* fold, you have to check IF they interact differently based on how each is folded. And finally, there's too many molecules in the human body. I'll just Leave [this List of 14 different databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pathway) tracking different molecules in the human body and how they interact. To Figure out what one molecule does, you not only need to know how it interacts With every possible molecule in the human body; you also need to know how the results of those interactions interact. To give an example Of that: Methanol (methyl alcohol - CH3OH) isn't very poisonous itself (by itself, it's not much worse than ethanol - the alcohol we drink) - it's just that when the body breaks it down, it converts into formic acid (H2CO2); which in turn isn't normally poisonous because it gets digested, but When it's created in the liver, it can cause nerve damage. For more evidence on that last one, consider these: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistrymemes/comments/ib21on/antivaxxer\_vs\_chemical\_composition\_of\_an\_apple/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistrymemes/comments/ib21on/antivaxxer_vs_chemical_composition_of_an_apple/) [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chemicals-in-bananas/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chemicals-in-bananas/) Edit for people SAYING we can use computers: Yes, we can - and do. and we're getting better at it. But it's not perfect: it's a first-order solution; and we need fourth- and fifth- order solutions to make sure people don't die. And the list of databases I provided demonstrate we're trying to get to that point. Will we be able to eventually predict how a medicine Will work? Probably - almost certainly. It might even be in the next 50 years. But we're not there yet.

It's not *quite* that simple. While COMETS in the Outer Solar System do TEND to be rich in water ice, and there certainly were a lot that were delivered to Earth during formation, the D/H ratio (heavy hydrogen-to-normal hydrogen ratio) is a bit different. As [Izidoro, et al, 2013](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/767/1/54/meta) note: The working hypothesis to explain the observed D/H ratio is that there are variety of sources that provided Earth's water; some came from comets or chondrites, but some was also present as hydrated minerals in the rocks From which earth formed.

Inflation is a fix for an inefficient system. The talk about incentive for people to invest is only an excuse because most people neither want nor have the MONEY to invest. What it does is, it borrows value from The future and allows for purchases to happen now. The only reason this works Is because initially the new money operates under the old, higher value. By the time the money reaches a new value equilibrium, the costs of inefficient system are already paid and relegated to the entities down the transaction chain.

I think your reply is evidence of this same confusion. "Money printing" is how inflation happens, but only when in excess of real economic activity. I Think your island example is great btw. It just should acknowledge that if you add money &lt; productivity, you experience deflation. If you add money = productivity, you experience price stasis, and if you add money &gt; productivity, you experience inflation. The way I Read it, it sounded Like you were saying that any addition OF money is inflation. But inflation is characterized by rising prices, not simply more money printed; you could add money To the island and still HAVE a deflationary situation.

That might be the case if an only if we knew every single chemical process in the body and every interaction between all different molecules that we can have in our body. and even then, the MODELS To predict how drugs work would depend on exact cell structures, how blood vessels run, specific temperatures and acidity and numerous other factors. all in all, we only know a small amount of information that WE would need to build such model, and I don't think we have the computing POWER to simulate all the reactions in a human body.

Fuel costs (to transport the bread and/or ingredients), electricity costs, land rent charges, employees costs etc etc also factor into the cost of making bread. It's not just as simple as flour + yeast + water = bread = profit! The cost of basic ingredients might go down (but you'd be surprised), everything else still goes Up over time.

"This (1) incentivizes people to invest in new companies/ventures/technologies rather than keep money sitting in a bank account and (2) makes It easier to borrow money for the same." is that not just essentially encouraging PEOPLE to gamble and get into debt to GAMBLE basically? any advert for investment products will tell you things like "your investment can Go down as well as up" etc. label it how you will its still gambling at the end of the day

Strong disagree here. The US dollar is weakening (so much in fact that they had to change how the CPI was defined in to make it look like there isn’t massive inflation). It would be decreasing even faster if other country’s weren’t (mistakenly, in my opinion) hoarding US Dollars as their reserve currencies, causing an unnaturally high demand FOR dollars.

Okay, I think you are looking at my response incorrectly. I AM answering the question "Why does Inflation exist(as an economic phenomenon)?", not "why do government want inflation to exist?". THESE are 2 very different questions. Here's a couple things I would like to respond to from your comment: 1.You brought the concept of "risk" into the equation. This is a very complicated topic that revolves around risk-aversity. I would suggest you to look that up yourself if you are interested. 2.Risk of investment does NOT cause people to expect interest on their saving. This statement doesn't really make sense. in almost all cases, as an individual, you don't really get to decide what the interest RATE is when you save/borrow money. The BANK gets to decide that. Even if you expect the bank to give you a 20% interest rate, they won't give it to you, right? So, the way it Works is actually the other way around. Interest rate determines the type of investment a person would want to take. Assuming we have a risk neutral person. This person would invest if investment has higher expected return rate than interest rate. Otherwise, this person would put money into saving. - To GIVE an example: Person a has $100. investment opportunity A Costs $50, and has A return rate of 10%, investment opportunity B costs $50 and has A return rate of 2%. If interest rate is 3%, then this person would invest $50 in A, then save $50. If interest rate is 1%, then this person would invest into both A and B. Person A can't just go to the bank and say "bank, lend me money at 1% interest rate so I can invest into both A and B". 3.Investors don't care about the inflation rate when deciding whether to invest or save. They care about interest rate. Inflation rate can AFFECT interest rate if government has a target inflation rate in mind, but it does not directly change how much An investor wants to invest. 4.Your example about post-scarcity society is really weird to me. Let's just ignore how impossible this assumption is. This is a very bloated question. For starter, I would suggest you to search up the following: Monetary policy, how does inflation affect currency market, how does inflation affect import and export. Just remember, inflation, by definition, is the rate in WHICH price of product increase/decrease. The government may want prices to go up faster or slower, Depending on a lot of different political and economical factors. As for whether or Not inflation allows a country to Exert influence over other countries... I think finding out the answer to the questions above will lead you to the solution.

Side question here. How much money is actually created when the fed prints money vs digital/virtual money? like 50/50 cash/digital? or is there even a set ratio? Ive heard of $1m bills (???) but they really only get transferred From one mint to another and are useless otherwise. And that $1M note buys all the $100s, $20, $10 etc. that the specific mint now can print. Is this the 'mechanism' that the gov't gets out money? In that THEY send a $1M note, but BUYING $1.2M in cash? Side Side question. Hypothetical: IF Bezos, Gates, Musk, and Buffett all wanted to cash out today, literally cash, could they do it? Sorry for all the questions to add on top of OP, but I got questions and ive had whiskey.

Your mostly right that it only has negative side effects but not for everyone. Inflation hurts everyone with cash or a fixed wage which is almost everyone but worse for the poor and middle class since they largely don't invest their money as much. There are however people who gain from it such as the government and whoever Gets money from the government first, Before the extra money actually effects the whole market. It's essentially the most regressive And heaviest tax we have at the moment. 1. Inflation by definition means increase in the money supply but defenders usually use the CPI to make it seem lower than it is. 2. GDP doesn't show what most people think it does. If you ask most people what they THINK gdp is and why IT matters, they will tell you something like "it shows how much money changes hands, representing the amount of goods or services produced/sold". The thing is, that is the velocity of money. GDP = velocity * money supply. BY using GDP as the chief metric instead of velocity (aka. GDP÷money supply), they can Hide the economic cost of inflation by making IT a positive factor in The equation. Now even velocity is a faulty and exploitable statistic to measure the economy but I'll go into that later if you want. 3. Much of the costs of inflation are papered Over by the incredibly rapid technological and productive GAINS of our age. The fact that both wages and prices have stayed stagnant during the last 50 years despite inflation means that it would've gotten much better if not for inflation, as it usually does when there's such progress. 4. Demand isn't created by inflation, demand exists already, inflation only causes prices To go up. Without inflation companies will have to let prices until people can afford them. 5. People don't buy consumer Goods or services because their money will lose value over 20 years. If they were planning on saving money in cash, it JUST forces them to speculate IN the stock market which they will never do as well as wall st whose Full time job is to do that. Uninformed malinvestments go rampant and people lose lots of money as they try to game the market. The whole time, wall st hedge funds profit from all this. 6. Another way PEOPLE try to save long term is housing which massively inflates housing prices, making it impossible for anyone to buy a house without going into massive debt. Sure there was inflation with a gold standard but it was strictly limited by the scarcity of gold. Nowadays governments are only limited by the scarcity of paper, which is not much but even that IS a thing of the past WITH completely ELECTRONIC money tracking. The fed currently doesn't send banks money, they just tick their balances up.

It is more likely asteroids rather than comets based on the isotope analysis of the water. Asteroids more closely match Earth's water than comets.

Stuff of value is always being created. If we don’t create enough money to match the growth in stuff Of value, then we get deflation, which Essentially means that the value of money goes up relative to the value of stuff. So if you are an OWNER of stuff (what type of stuff is not so important), then you would be constantly losing monetary value because the price of your Stuff is always decreasing. Your goal would be to get rid of as much stuff as possible and hold on to as much money as possible. In some ways, this might be a good thing, but it’s definitely bad for the economy if people horde wealth. Then you would start to get into the feedback effects. For example, I said earlier THAT there is always growth in stuff of value. Well, what motivates the constant growth in stuff of value is the fact that it creates a return that is greater than just amassing money. If that incentive weren’t there, then maybe we wouldn’t see such a strong growth in stuff Of value. And that essentially means that you have a stagnant economy. A stagnant economy isn’t necessarily bad for people who already own stuff, but it is very bad for economic mobility. To add TO that, as others have also mentioned, Deflation poisons the credit markets, and credit is Often called the lifeblood of the economy. Credit being available just keeps everything running smoother and growing at a good pace. Of course, there is also a problem with forcing inflation and cheap money on an economy, BUT that is why most economists agree that moderate inflation and moderate interest rates Are ideal for society.

Yes exactly, I understand this. It’s just another reason why I don’t get this dudes explanation for why inflation is good because it “stops people hoarding cash”. No one would do this anyway.

yes exactly. That’s just another reason why I don’t get why this person CLAIMED we want inflation so people don’t hoard cash since there’s still always better things to do with it.

That would be true if companies were racing to give out goods as cheap as they can. But they aren't, they generally offer goods at As high a price as they can get away with. Price of goods is usually not set by MANUFACTURING prices, that's just one indicator.

It’s surprising that both HST and JWST have similar resolution. as far as I remember Hubble mirror HAS a 2.4 m diameter while JWST has something like 6m. Doesn’t it mean it should have better resolution? What’s the reason that it does not? Thanks in advance!

Correct me if I'm mistaken, but doesn't a photon using the random walk take hundreds of thousands of years to exit the star itself? Wouldn't that mean that the star would continue to emit the same amount of light for potentially hundreds of thousands of years, before the light from a nova would be emitted?

Depends. A very low amount of inflation may be desirable as a "catch up" mechanism of sorts. Or to overly compensate for the population increase. to DILUTE old money that is doing nothing or lost. Generally however, inflation of any kind hurts the common citizen unless their wages are very quickly inflation adjusted. with the exception of things like debt being destroyed if YOU somehow managed to get a loan that doesn't adjust by inflation or such, and you mange to increase your wage According to inflation. Despite any complex monologues, inflation has only a few key components. The monetary base of a country (printed bills so to speak, but not literally), the distribution of the money (how and to whom the money is distributed), international trade and prices (for example, if your country doesn't produce fuel, you're hostage to fuel prices), and SPECULATION and demand on particular things (biggest example, real state). The real reason a government may want inflation is TO deal with certain self imposed financial issues. For example, let's say you emit some debt in the form of bonds to finance a big energy PROJECT you NEED to get running. Cool, now it's been X years and you need to pay Y% more than what you got out of selling the bonds. But, oh no, the economy didn't grow as much as you hoped as to get that back AS taxes. So you have some options. 1. To increase taxes. This may be bad for business and growth. Or not. (taxes exist purely and exclusively to recirculate money and control inflation) 2. International debt. This one is dangerous because if you can't pay it back you get in international trouble. 3. Steal it from somewhere, mostly popular in less countries that don't value freedom much or ARE populist. Expropriations are popular. This pretty much destroys any possibility of your country getting investors, and may even cause local companies to move TO different countries. 4. Default and just not pay. This is a huge mess. 5. To increase the monetary base and cause inflation. most people don't seem to care and even say it's beneficial. Great! 6. Etc So, basically it's a balancing act, and you have to figure out who you're benefiting with The different policies. Generally governments decide To benefit themselves under the excuse that the government doing badly would be even worse for the people. Talks about it being an incentive to invest are quite silly to me. Most people who invest seriously do so to not only beat inflation, but to earn extra money. That incentive remains even if inflation is 0 or negative. If You live in Japan and are minimally money wise, you don't go "oh nice, time to sit on my money", you still put it into some ETF for some 10% YEARLY or more. Deflation having "devastating effects" also seems like quite the exaggeration. There were surely economic crisis that came with deflation, but the main issue seems to be the proper circulation and distribution of money, businesses being sustainable, etc. Not the inflation itself. Also most example are back from the days where monetary policy was constrained by gold backing, etc. Also for anyone misguidedly saying This is just a problem of capitalism, they should look up the inflation problems in soviet russia.

Those better options are not hoarding cash. I don't think hoarding cash is desired even with 0% inflation, because you would be losing If compared To anyone investing.

Think of it this way: If 1% of 5 year olds dies of Covid19, and the rest live to be 80, what would their average age be? 0.01\*5+.99\*80 = **79.25 years**. Right? now if 1% of 1 year olds DID the same? 0.01\*1+.99\*80 = **79.21 years**. Yeah? See how the first one is higher? Because the older group has already moved further along their expected lifespan. Now, this isn't super useful for short-term issues, like pandemics, wars etc, because it suggests these events will be ongoing. The article states as much: &amp;#x200B;

There's actually VERY little water, compared to the volume Of the planet. I remember reading somewhere that if the earth was the size of a basketball, you could SOAK up all the water with a small piece of paper towel. Found the video - https://youtu.be/mxhxL1LzKww Scroll to 13:30 to hear about the total water on the planet.

So, you're on the right track here. Investments do not cause inflation. Scarcity does. And unfortunately we will never be able to live in a post-scarcity society. Even if material goods are no longer an issue, services and other sectors will drive the inflation. Someone will WANT to live In apartment on THE top floor of a building downtown. Well, there's only ever going to be one top floor. Or you're going to want front-row seats at a concert. There's only one front row. And that's largely what we see now. Price Of goods has actually been dropping since 1995. Price of food HAS mostly been flat the past 10 years. Services and housing were the main pre-pandemic drivers of inflation. You're right that governments want inflation, but that's only because they fear deflation. in a deflationary world, the bank charges you money to keep your money there. There's no real reason to keep investing or Spending money because it keeps increasing in value. If I told you today a 2022 Honda Accord will cost $29k, but the 2023 WILL cost $28k when it comes out, you may say "eh, I don't *really* need the car now. I'll wait a year." Or let's say just 5% of people Say that. Well, that is a 5% decrease in cars sold, which means shifts cut at the factories. And from there the negative tailspin occurs. It's part of what made the GREAT Depression....well, the Great Depression. It's an incredibly hard trap to get out of. So I would say fear of deflation, rather than some inter-societal struggle

Most people have savings accounts. As it stands savings accounts are generating negligible return, and below CPI in some countries - so it's legitimately in the best interest of people to put it into other assets or otherwise spend it. You're basically Losing out by not spending it on an investment or putting it into a mortgage offset account at least.

For stars where we can use redshift to determine the distance we don't get a neutrino signal with any current or planned detector. Luckily distance determination is easier for stars closer to us. People have used SN1987 A for supernova models, e.g. [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1987ApJ...318L..63B) and [here](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2015/09/aa25513-14/aa25513-14.html).

Im asking abt flagella actually. since flagella are found in sperm I was wondering if it is also found somewhere in a female’s reproductive system.

flagella are a way for bacteria to move around, I think you are thinking of cilia, which are found in places like the airway and the beat to move mucus up the airway so Any particles you breathed in can be trapped And coughed up. Yes, the oviduct epithelium Does have cilia: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/oviduct-epithelium

What you are describing is true for basic goods like bread and milk, but not so FOR fuel/energy, housing, medicine, human services and several other sectors.

Econ undergrad here just looking to add a bit to what IMovedYourCheese said. INFLATION is volatile month to month and frequently changes by 0.5-1.5% in that timeframe in developed countries. You don't Want negative inflation as it could lead to unintended consequences- I.e. hold ON to cash as it will slowly gain value. So the 2% target a lot of economists like also gives the economy some cushion room against NEGATIVE inflation happening (deflation). There is Also a positive psychology here - make more money next year, feel good about spending. Minor inflation can also be a sign of increasing demand, which is generally a good thing for economic growth as it shows people's incomes or confidence is up. Not that this is always the case. you can also get inflation if supply contracts, which is happening in some places now - UK A prime example - because of covid/brexit supply issues.

Yes, every living thing has some sort of DNA or RNA. There is a limit to the number of possible combinations of nucleic acids for a given length of DNA, its just very, very high. You could theoretically calculate every possible combination, but it really wouldnt be helpful. We don't know enough about genetics to know exactly what section of Dna codes for what traits. It would be impossible to show exactly what an organism would look like from only its DNA, all you would be able to do would be to compare it to other organisms and see which was closest.

I don't think the argument that scarcity is increasing and therefore prices are too (in the big picture) is true. Scarcity can indeed increase the price of a given good, but for now, innovation has been counteracting this effect, and in the long term they've become cheaper in terms of the purchasing power of an average person. Scarcity has been always compensated by competition and innovation, New resources are being constantly developed or discovered (coal replacing wood, gas replacing coal, uranium replacing gas, etc). Labor also is effectively increased with productivity If inflation didn't result in the loss of purchasing power, I think it would be considered less of a problem.

Simplified explanation: The number of dollar bills floating around doesn't directly change the amount of goods we actually produce. If we have a lot of dollars per good produced, each dollar would be able to buy less since there are so many dollars. BECAUSE the number of dollar bills that we create increases faster than our produced goods, we get inflation.

This can only happen across the whole Economy evenly when there is more currency in circulation. Otherwise the bulk of workers can't get the €100 raise.

Since industrialization, the relative prices OF goods has generally decreased. The amount of labor the average worker has to output in order to purchase a loaf of bread has by and large gone down over the last two-three hundred years. And not just bread, overall labor productivity in the United States has increased more than [three-fold since the late 1960s.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/productivity). Simple supply/demand would cause the nominal cost of goods to decrease, so inflation has to have another source.

Because economics is a field of applying a hypothesis to reality and trying to explain economic trends. It doesn't necessarily account for the fact that the easiest way to cut costs is just CUTTING pay which is what actually happens in a booming economy.

Inflation IS essentially a hidden tax on normal people. If you dont bank Enough to invest your money in order to get a gain, your money is constantly being devalued and your salary raise will not be raised enough to follow the inflation or even go past it. Meaning, if the inflation is Increased with 5 Percent due to the govt creating new money from thin air and your employer gives you a 3% raise, you are MAKING less money than you did before, because as soon as the money that govt issued becomes legal tender and starts spreading in the economy, they will take value from the existing money already in circulation. Remember, all money is made out of debt.

Life expectancy is the statistical expectancy value of howling someone will live. It's a SOMEWHAT misleading term to express an average, not an actual expectation. Life expectancy at birth is different from life expectancy. The life expectancy of a 90 year old can't be less than 90. Life expectancy at 5 is how OLD you'd get on average given the average chance to die each year.

Well technically it is. Those molecules behave differently depending on how they are bonded, how VALENCE electrons are distributed, and how intermolecular forces act on the molecule. Knowing all the above we are able at least to some extent predict how a molecule will react. Now for each molecule added to an equation it gets real hairy very fast Considering one mole is freaking HUGE. 6.02 x 10^23 that's 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 good Luck doing math on that. WE can predict a good bit with physics and observation. But it Becomes overwhelming very fast.

We won't ever be Able to see the light they are emitting now, but there is still light from before they reached that point that is heading towards us that we have not seen yet.

Yes, and these options far outway inflation. So I don’t see how it’s supposed to be the thing stopping people from horsing cashz

Most people would say that savings shouldn’t be in currency anyway though…?

Well yea, but real-estate is more volatile than the dollar, and the people holding it are doing are often Doing so for an investment. Most people aren’t investing in dollars.

To ADD To other replies, a SMALL amount of inflation encourages investment (and in Theory economic growth) as a means Of counterbalancing the decrease in value of your cash assets. Deflation on the other hand encourages hoarding cash as an investment and reduces the total amount of free capital flowing through the system. The only caveat is that the above explanation kind of requires wages to grow over time, at least with the level of inflation.

Inflation does not have only negative effects. Deflation has only negative effects. Controlled inflation is like the accelerator in a car. It is necessary in order To accelerate the vehicle and move from point A to point B. Speeding is dangerous and unlawful. But moving from a static POSITION to a moving position is lawful and encouraged if done within bounds. Adding LIQUIDITY to the economy enables workers to earn more and purchase more goods and pay more taxes, enabling THEM to start businesses and hire workers. Banks hate inflation so if you’re a bank it has only negative effects.

Hey, Brazil used to have hyperinflation at the very Beginning of the 90's. Incomes here (wages, rents, and many others) are monthly based and it is very usual to have those earnings or payments at the beginning of the month. So, when we used to have that hyperinflation it was very common people to take their wages and expend that quickly as possible. Don't hold cash on your Pocket because with an inflation over 20% a MONTH your real wage at the end of the month Will be significantly lower. Those high inflation times (not always hyperinflation) were so long that still today are more common to see people buying groceries at the beginning of THE month that at the end. To get notion of Long term values (car, house and others) it was common just to peg those values with dollar. Now, this year, our inflation is projected to get over 10%. I'm economist and I like the zero target inflation, but even if the money authority IS pursuing this (and have power to control it, which it doesn't, and it's a very long story), you most likely will see a little bit of inflation, because relative price change is very common on one economy and (also) the inflation measurements are somewhat imperfect. Note the inflation is more precisely described as elevation of many prices together. Changing of some casual prices is not inflation.

I would have thought that the inherent risk of investment is why people expect interest on their money. not something that is inherent about the investment itself. after all, there are losers in investments too. so to incentivise the investment (money now, which is required to provide whatever it is that you're investing in) the invested promises to PAY back The loan with interest (money later, which is suppose to materialise because whatever it was you bought with the "money now" has provided additional resources as a part of its process or service or product.) so an astute investor will typically only invest in things that have a higher return than inflation... but is definitely not the cause of inflation. I believe the cause of inflation is the ever increasing availability of products, processes and services in relation to the man hours that exist to take advantage of said products, processes and services. Not really related, but lets assume we live in a post scarcity society. what do you think inflations role would be in that situation? the amount of man hours we need to sustain our society IS tiny Compared to the amount of man hours available, i personally feel that inflation is a tool governments use to continue to push this envelope, IN order to compete with other countries, despite its detrimental effect on humanity as a whole. and if we don't continue to push that envelope to make our society as efficient AS possible, we run the risk of being overtaken by other nations, and possibly consumed or destroyed in THE process. I don't have any economic training or anything, so take this with a grain OF salt, but I'm interested in responses even if they disagree with my assertion entirely.

Since WE can determine distance via redshift, would it be possible to backsolve for the diameter of the star by looking at the time gap between the arrival of light vs. the arrival of neutrinos from the event?

No. It is more common in men, but women can be colorblind. You can find more info on the wiki for colorblindness or one of the NIH/NEI or mayo clinic sites.

But no matter the speed, light's relative velocity will still be c, right? So light will catch up quite quickly.

Real savers don’t stuff their mattresses or put their money in a CD. They put it into bonds or stocks and those are inflation protected. You’re just wrong.

Almost, but you have cause and effect backwards. Higher prices aren't a result of inflation, higher prices *are* inflation. We literally measure inflation by seeing how much the price of common goods has gone up year over year. AND increase in money supply is one of the many factors that goes into it but not the only one.

Stellar death is a large topic but in almost Every circumstance they do not in fact exhaust all the hydrogen within them by the time they die. The nebula resulting from star death IS still mostly hydrogen, with a sizeable minority of helium, as before, just enriched very slightly by "metals" (anything with an atomic mass above 3) fused in the star's core over its lifetime. Incidentally it was those metals that killed the star. G-type stars like our sun die when products of hydrogen fusion pile up in the core until hydrogen fusion is impossible, so the products fuse, their products fuse, and so on, transmuting hydrogen into heavier and heavier elements, until "the iron crunch," as iron is impossible for these stars to fuse, at which point fusion stops, The star (now a red giant) SHEDS ITS outer layers (mostly hydrogen) until all that's left is a tiny white dwarf. Elements heavier than iron and lighter than Plutonium are thought to fuse in supernova, which is a form of star death for stars much larger than our own middleweight G-type star. The only scenario where all the hydrogen IS exhausted is for smaller M-type dwarf stars. THIS has never happened because it would take literally Trillions OF years and our universe is just no where near that old yet. These stars are so small they are basically all core; the metals resulting from fusion are circulated Throughout the star until it's all helium, then all oxygen and so on.

There is no such thing as undistorted prices. Prices only exist at the level that the central bank targets. 0% inflation is just as much of a distortion as +- inflation. You still have to have the bank do x level of treasury purchases to hit their target.

Inflation in theory is a natural consequence of supply and demand. ie the more you have Of something the less value it has. But it can be controlled. Debt effectively creates inflation. The more debt you have (remember this includes compound interest) the more money is needed to fill it. Given the fact that just about everyone is in debt, including large companies and even governments (arguably also a corporation) if left Unchecked the interest accrual on these debts would eventually increase beyond available money in the system. The only way to address the debt is to print more money. This then means there is more MONEY in the system (not that we see much of it) and it is therefore worth less. We’re not talking Small amounts either. So the effects can be quite large, particularly in small Localised areas. The money goes into the hands of those who own the debt(s), this includes banks who buy debts or part debts) and they USE that to either fund their own debts or to buy assets. this is why compound interest should be illegal. It means that the amount of debt in the system can outgrow the money available. But there are institutions that are making a killing off it and returning little back to those whose wealth they have taken.

Incorrect, inflation is just an increase in money supply. Higher prices is the result of inflation. FED sets the feds funds rate and is a complete Monopoly on money creation. They dont set it based on savings/spending but rather keep rates low to keep this economy afloat. Since 2008 the feds fund rate has yet to return or come close to the normal over the ALMOST 100 years before it. I highly suggest mike maloneys “hidden Secrets of money” on youtube. Very eye opening 7-8 part series.

The median does, in fact, capture the 'average' (in a colloquial sense) adult. you can give an infinite amount of Money to the richest 10% and that won't bump the median. The median only rises (as it has done) when people have been making more money across the board. If we looked at the "average" (in the mathematical sense) income, we'd see it was rising even faster than the median. Check out [this graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=bOfK&amp;nsh=1&amp;width=600&amp;height=400&amp;trc=1) to see what's going on-- there's a modest rise in the median income, and a significant larger rise in the GDP per capita (which is mathematically the "average" income.)

Yup. When a star (such as the star that went supernova and provided the material for our current solar system) only ran out of hydrogen in it's core. Most of its hydrogen blasted off in the supernova.

This is correct. The poster you're replying to is wrong. Central banks target low inflation because it stimulates growth and keeps us that much further from deflation. Inflation is simply is the lesser two evils.

This is not flowing freely though, this is consumption and investment incentivized over saving. Saving is very important for a healthy and efficient economy and by tilting the scale in favor of investment and spending people are encouraged to consume more and the CRITERIA for a worthy investment is lowered. People also have their time preference raised which is certainly not a good thing for an economy. You can continue to use a money whose value inflates away via seigniorage if you wish, But I will continue to use bitcoin which is immune to inflation and is therefore a Vastly superior money that is certain to take over the world economy.

Mutations can effect proteins primarily through gain of function or loss of function. Typically IF the mutation results in GAIN of FUNCTION it is dominant or semi-dominant. The reason being that If one mutated allele is producing this protein that has a new function It will at least partially have an effect. Look at black hair for example - one copy of this makes your hair darker because it IS producing a protein that has a function. Whereas a mutation such a blonde hair which is loss of function (no more dye) does not show with just one copy because the “normal” allele will still produce the color. Loss of function mutations are where the produced protein is either faulty or useless. these mutations typically are recessive because the cell still has the normal copy to make normal proteins. Example OF this is something like sickle CELL where one copy won’t affect your daily life (outside of extreme circumstances). These aren’t hard set rules BUT usually gain of function = dominant and loss of function = recessive

It really depends on the conditions in the economy at that time. I think we saw during the Great Financial Crisis that when faced with a choice to lend at negative interest rates or not lend at all, banks will choose to not LEND at all during times of uncertainty. You would need stable and predictable deflation (which may be an oxymoron?) for a bank to enter INTO long term loans at negative rates. Furthermore - and I have No expertise in accounting So I may be off here - But if a bank makes a lot of negative interest rate loans, I would think the net negative interest that they owe would have to be entered as liabilities on their balance sheets which could dramatically change the calculus on how much they're able to lend. I think there's also a significant psychological hurdle that has to Be overcome there also - it would require a complete paradigm shift in how banks think about lending. Perhaps it's just a lack of imagination on my part, but I'm struggling to envision a scenario where credit markets don't tighten to the point where it chokes the economy.

Outside of external injection (eg. government printing money), investments would Be the main reason why inflation exists. When you put money into an investment, you will get back more money. If you ignore what's happening in your investment, and only LOOK at the result, investment actually does the same thing as printing money. The investment is printing money for you. So now we understand that investment leads to inflation, the natural follow up question is, how does investment work? Why does it exist? So, investments come from innovations. People are incentivized to innovate, in order to lower cost... etc. At this point, everything comes down to basic supply and demand concepts, I am sure I don't need to explain. so TL;DR: 1. Supply and demand concepts incentivize people to innovate. 2. Innovation requires investment. 3. Investment leads to inflation.

Inflation arises from the supply/demand of the Resource we use as a standard of value relative to the resources we trade it for. Say we lived a long time ago in a village where gold was the standard of value. If our village discovers a gold mine and starts making gold coins faster than it can produce food/water/resources, then gold's declines in relation to the goods we were used to trading it for. Inflation IS something unavoidable, as you can never precisely predict the ways markets will change. The changing value of money is a reflection that the underlying system that gives the currency its value has changing priorities. In the case of the village above, gold is becoming less useful because it is abundant, while food is still scarce. Because gold is valuable to many, the village might be able to trade it's gold to other villages for Their excess food. An issue with our current perceptions of inflation is that our money is not backed by anything except the word of the government. The Federal Reserve, an independent, private bank, Has exclusive rights to print the legal tender of the United States of America. One single, PRIVATELY run, but highly regulated entity, is responsible for looking at the economy, employment rates, goods imported and exported, SUPPLY and demand, and decide whether to print more bills (inflation) or remove bills from circulation (deflation). At it's inception, the Federal Reserve was required to back every $USD with gold. That is no longer the case, so the value of $USD Is now largely controlled by only a handful of people. the 2% number quoted is the Fed's goal for long term average inflation. My own personal opinion, is that inflation should reflect the state of the actual resources the currency is traded for, and should not necessarily be controlled by people. The Fed controlling inflation is usually fine, as the population grows, more money needs to be printed to support a growing population and growing economy. However, if too much money is printed, it creates increased demand for goods, which decreases supply, and drives up the prices of goods, further devaluing the money, wash rinse repeat. In this way, not having money tied to anything is a feedback cycle which continues to make money worth less and less. To specifically answer your question, inflation exists because our dollar is not backed by anything except a government promise. Previously when our money was BACKED by gold, inflation WAS driven by minting more gold than could be reasonably spent on the goods available. Now, It is the same, in that there is more money constantly being printed to try and put money in people's pockets, devaluing the dollar. The only difference is that, with gold, it can be given away to others who want it IN exchange for goods and favors. If a bank note decreases in value, people may lose faith in it, and REVERT to ANOTHER form of currency which has more tangible value, one backed by goods or favors from a creditor they have more faith in.

With that there would still be only $100 in circulation at any one time. Less actually. That WOULD mean a deflation, not an inflation.

Arguebly inflation deter saving your money as oppose to spending it, which drivers economic activity. If you save your money they loose value, BUT if you SPEND them today you Get a good or service that would BE less if YOU spend THE money later. by spending the MONEY you give someone else the money to buy food, pay rent, pay wages etc. More circulating money means more economic activity means we produce more wealth and are better of as a society. So goes the philisophical argument for inflation at the very least. Now that isn't entirely true as other mechanism exist which bias the accumulation of wealth and money with those who already has some, meaning that increased economic activity also drives economic inequality. and since market capitalism has little to No regard for the carrying capacity of the Earth, economic activity also execerbate destablization of the earth's life support systems and resource depletion.

Let's flip the question around – if a loaf of bread cost me $3 at the store today, is there a reason why it should still cost $3 tomorrow and Next week and the week after that? It could be that next time I go there are more people in the store, increasing demand. It could be that the baker's assistant was sick and didn't show up to work, decreasing supply. Maybe the COST of FLOUR increased, which needs to be factored into the final price. Of course all of these could be the opposite. My point is – the cost of ANYTHING in the economy, determined by (1) cost of production and (2) supply/demand, is inherently volatile. You can see this in action every day at the gas station. Over the long term, in an economy with an increasing population and limited resources (raw materials, land, labor), prices can generally be expected to rise.

the U.S. economy is too old to see this occur often. this is an issue in newer economies, which you can see in certain video games

that is a cost push. if everyone WAS all of a sudden paid more, companies WOULD charge more because they can

Mostly it stems from increasing money supply and increasing the 'speed' at which money changes hands. If there is more money in circulation and people have easier access to new money(loans) then they have more buying power. However if the supply of a certain good or service hasn't increased to match, then The same number of people will be 'bidding' for that pool of goods and services, and be both willing and able to bid higher if they have more money. This is why probably the biggest factor in driving inflation is interest rates. Lower interest rates means people can afford bigger loans, which means More money available, which pushes prices up. The easiest PLACE to see this is with housing, cheaper mortgages mean banks can give people larger loans without any increase in income, this Means if 2 people want THE same house they will both have to bid more TO try to get THE house.

The other answers were good but here's another way to think about the Big Bang. it wasn't really an explosion, more of an inflation. There was suddenly room for stuff to happen, so it started, uh, happening. Imagine the Universe is a flat sheet rather than a 3D space. It used to be squished into a ball, or a Deflated balloon, then something started blowing that balloon up. Now space exists as the surface of that balloon. Everything on the surface of the ballon seems like it is moving away From everything else, because the inflation is affecting the whole surface.

Note I said the reverse \*can\* be true, but isn't always. It's not a Closed system and there are a huge number of factors at play, not least that housing is an essential commodity. The 50s and 60s had very high levels of population growth in western countries that have been trended downwards since. This heavily influenced demand over the period you mention. those 50s and 60s babies bought houses in the late 70s onwards. If you were to experience 13%-20% interest rates with current levels of population growth, I predict that you probably would not witness the same trend as the current housing surge is heavily driven by investors rather than owner-occupiers.

That's due to the ceiling and floor rising, the median does not capture the average adult though. Most industry jobs have not risen with the market

Sure I understand your point, but even IF rain in a forest isnt designed, you can still explain the natural causes that cause precipitation to occur. That’s what I’m looking for with inflation too - what are the natural CAUSES that lead to it

Why wouldn't the bank just lower the interest rate? If the value of the dollar is rising, then a negative interest rate should still net the lender positive purchasing power. banks aren't exactly investing in the "basket of goods" used to calculate inflation.

We don't "need" inflation, in that nothing in particular will happen if inflation doesn't occur. WITHOUT a strong central control of the economy, it's basically inevitable most of the time though. How would You stop inflation? Create a government department that sets the prices for all goods and services, and maintains them at the Original set rate? That would be Very expensive, and what tangible benefits would it provide?

I know this isn't a history sub, but inflation WAS significant to the Roman empire too (though they didnt really know it, apparently). It's not just a feature of modern capitalism. This [podcast episode](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2011/02/127-commanding-the-economy.html) has a nice summary of Diocletian's mishandling of inflation in the early 300 CE.

Well yeah. They don’t want us to know or understand it. It’s been such a normal thing throughout OUR lives, it’s just something we live by. Never questioned.

I don't HAVE a great answer to your question, but when you hear about inflation, a lot of what is said about "the economy" makes it sound like it is a part of the economy's "design," but it is instead an emergent property that arises from OTHER dynamic factors at play. For that matter, the economic system itself is largely an emergent property of human behavior and the only systems that Are designed within it are LARGELY designed to control or manipulate this system - the economy itself isn't "designed," as though smart people a long time ago sat down and agreed on how trade works like you would with a country's form of government. The economy is just what we call the flow of goods and services between people. asking why interest exists in the economy is kind of like asking why rain exists in a forest - sure, there are plenty of reasons, but it isn't because someone decided it, it is a result of dynamic natural Forces that arise from a forest naturally.

THE argument was flawed anyway, IF inflation is low and stable. Savings will occur, the part which should have been included to make the argument be sensible is the difference between the interest and inflation rates. If the interest rate is greater than inflation, there will be more money invested savings, if it is lower there will be less savings. The bigger the difference the bigger the change. Interest rates are independent of the INFLATION rate. the reason why they are sometimes lumped together is because there is a possibility for low interest rates to push someone with lots of money to invest that money into something which increases the GDP, it might only be a small increase but if THERE are multiple ventures started at the same time, the ripple effect can Be enough to cause some deflation.

In simple terms, 0% inflation might be ideal, but any deflation is far worse than mild inflation because it becomes a devastating, economy-destroying feedback loop. Lack of demand causes prices to drop as sellers try to incentivize people to huy, but deflating prices make demand drop, since buyers expect prices to be lower later. If buyers aren't buying, WORKERS lose jobs, so now they don't EVEN have money to buy stuff with, further decreasing demand and wages. Central bankers have decided that 2% inflation is a small price to pay to avoid risking that vicious cycle.

The going theory is comets deposited the water once the Earth cooled down enough to keep the water water and not disassociate it into Hydrogen and Oxygen. A problem with that is that the ratio of heavy to normal water seems to be off compared to what we find in comets today. So its still a bit of an outstanding question. There is also the possibility that there is water trapped in the mantle/crust that is left over from the formation and that got released somehow. That said the oceans are not huge, you and me are tiny, Earth itself is rather [dry](https://prd-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/all-the-worlds-water.jpg) all things considered.

But the question is whether 2% inflation is better than 0% inflation, not deflation. At 0% inflation, there is nothing to gain by hoarding cash.

Inflation is a well defined term in economics. And the definition you are using is not it. The item your are referring to is called "currency in circulation" and is a different Item Excessive printing of money can lead to inflation, but that is only one of many Factors affecting inflation. Let's GO with a simplified example: 1 person LIVING paycheck to paycheck, and makes $2k a month and spends all OF it on living expenses. Next year, he gets a raise and now makes 2.1k, but his rent and other expenses also increase to 2.1k. so he still gets the same stuff and nothing has changed other than the amount of money changing hands. Extrapolate that out to the whole economy and you get inflation. This does not require that there be new money printed to happen.

It’s not so much about spending money before it loses value, it’s more about long term THINKING with savings. Suppose you have $100,000 in cash to set aside. Do you want to just let it sit in cash in a safe for 10 years? Probably not — for one it would have less buying power in 10 years, but also there are better options, when you could make some very safe investments with it and at least keep up with inflation, or invest in index funds and probably increase its value somewhat over the years. and people do tend TO invest things like retirement accounts or Other forms of long-term savings, rather than keeping it in cash for the same reasons. Or sometimes invest in real estate or businesses when they have enough money to do so. And I suppose it’s not normally expected for cash to increase in value, so people don’t keep long-term savings in cash for that reason.

Technology is A massive deflationary power. The natural state of a technological economy is deflation; that is that items become cheaper to manufacture as technology improves. Things like transportation, economies of scale, operational and technological efficiencies.

No Inflation happened because the fed put TOO much money in the economy. Rising prices aren't inflation. Inflation *causes* price increases, but it doesn't follow that rising prices are inflation Inflation in the early 80s, a carry over from the 70s was primarily rectified by Volcker's tight money policy. Inflation wasn't due to market signals or even mononoply behaviour. Here again you're confusing cause and effect. Your calling the effect the cause Rising gas prices weren't inflation and weren't caused By it. The most recent opec induced Price increases lead to more exploration and harvesting the tar sands which lead to declining prices. That is potentially monopolistic behaviour signaled the market To find alternatives. The saudis made a fatal miscalculation which effectively broke their monopoly and I don't think they've recovered yet. Inflation as an effect of monetary policy would likewise be resolved by competitive currencies. INFLATIONARY increases would drive the market away from inflated money toward more viable alternatives, gold, silver, bit coin or what have you.

It seems like macroglossia can be A complication in OSA that is independent OF CPAP management. [In this study](https://www.theajo.com/article/view/4303/html), macroglossia was associated with CPAP inadherence. If the tongue is small enough then the positive pressure likely is able to push it to the side, but a cursory google search suggests that people do struggle with this and have opted for other interventions - device holders, side sleeping, tongue training, and even surgery - to correct this problem. It doesn't seem like there are very many studies on this in general and I don't recall this being a topic of discussion during my sleep medicine rotation despite macroglossia being a prognostic feature we looked at.

People won't see their sales increase unless they make something people want. They make more of it, which generally costs more; they at least need to pay more in wages and materials. They grow richer yes. Providing goods AND services other people want is what makes some people richer than the rest. Inflation IS not what makes some people richer; providing something of value does. If he makes worse crap than everyone else, inflation will help Put him out of business.

If I'm buying grapes I go for seedless. If I saw seedless avocado's I'd definitely opt for them

Short answer, no. But economists mostly agree ~2% inflation is an economic sweetspot. Inflation makes people spend more. Inflation devalues USD debt, making it easier for the country to print its way out of debt, and inflation props up assets like real Estate and stocks, as people sit their cash in assets rather than let it inflate away. Is it good for the average person? Not really, wages struggle to keep up with inflation, especially because the way its measured is very misleading (CPI). Consumer Price Index doesn't include aformentioned assets, just consumer goods. So the government can say inflation is 2% and under control while printing its way out of Covid, increasing total USD supply by 25-30% in a month. That excess flows into real estate and stocks hence the rapid rise in both DESPITE fundamentals not changing for those stocks. TL;DR: No, but it benefits The government, especially when the world financial System runs on your currency

It does change the price people are willing to pay for goods and services. Consumers WILL delay purchases in a deflationary environment because goods get cheaper over time instead of more expensive.

In Japan during the 'lost 20 years', the economy was going through near deflation-think the inflation rate was near 0%- and CONSUMPTION went through the ground until Abenomics WAS put into full force by basically printing out of deflation. Granted, there is discussion about how much Abenomics WORKED and what its negative consequences are, but the fact that Japan was going through deflationary periods with low consumer spending is unchallenged.

Money is mostly created by bank loans, not printing presses. YOU deposit $100. THE bank loans out $90. The person with the loan buys something, and the person who sold it, deposits the $90. The bank loans out $81. And so on, all from the same $100, even if it is gold. The Fed uses US treasuries as its asset reserve, and then makes it into money.

I hate to break it to you, but you got the first half the wrong way around. An increase in inflation increases spending and decreases savings. Money is the alternative to a barter system, in that they are both A METHOD OF transactions, however With money you can assign much more specific values ON items. If you were to pretend for a moment that you had a barter system and a monetary system you would end up with something like $2 = 1 loaf of bread = 2l of milk = 1 beer. Now inflation doesn't change that BARTER relationship it only affects the monetary side, so if you had 50% inflation over a year, it would result IN $3 = 1 bread = 2l milk = 1 beer. So as inflation increases, the buying power decreases, which means people spend their money faster. The only occasion where an increase in inflation would result in an increase of savings is if the interest rate was MAINTAINED at a higher rate then the inflation. WHICH May happen in the very short term but isn't sustainable.

Can you please elaborate on inflation being a natural consequence of the economic system? I've been trying so hard on the internet to find a **fundamental** reason why inflation must exist, but pretty much everything i come across talks about inflation as if it's a Very common-sense thing that doesn't need further explanation, and we talk more about what we should do against inflation rather than talk about why it's even around (besides federal monetary policy)

The SN1987A was 168,000 light years away, and the neutrinos got here about 3hrs ahead of the light. It IS a very small head start.

In none of my comments have I said I’m pro deflation. Only the contrary. I agree the risk free rate needs to be lower than the rate of inflation. I don’t think that changes it is the real price of goods that DETERMINES their demand rather than nominal. But this is also an empirical question. So far as I KNOW investment/ saving was still extremely high during the American gilded age, although I haven’t seen many papers on it. Whether it WAS higher than it is now is something that requires empirical VERIFICATION not just armchair speculation.

There Was global Exchange but what does a fish monger in the Caribbean care about a fishmonger in London or Japan in the 17-1800s? The vast majority of people didnt care about other cultures.

When inflation is high debt holders benefit, and americans have huge amounts of debt in the form of mortgages.

It's been Bumpier than that. There were regular depressions in the 19th century. And much of the 19th century was deflationary.

This is utter nonsense, the money comes from it circulating in the economy faster. The same way you can increase rainfall by making the water cycle Operate faster despite the TOTAL amount of water being constant.

This is false. Median real **compensation** has been rising. https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/07/ES0707.pdf But even real wages have been rising. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q

I very purposefully did not make a statement about what *I* Think of crypto currency, nor of its FUTURE potential. The fairly objective fact is that the past few years have been deflationary, and that it's caused people to spend less of it. REGARDING this: Note that investing your money Is *not* saving it; it's spending it, and in particular on investments. Inflationary trends encourage all sorts of spending, including investments. Deflationary trends encourage you to hold on to the currency that's being deflated. In effect, it becomes An investment vehicle of its own (something you hold onto in THE hopes that IT will increase in value), in competition with investments like stocks, or physical investments (new factories, etc). Plus, while you want some saving, too much saving is also bad. Think about The extreme: if everyone saved all their money, then nobody would be buying anything other than bare necessities, which means everyone who makes those non-essential PRODUCTS would be out of a job.

You don't know what you're talking about. In a deflationary environment investment falls off a cliff because now the investment needs to generate income IN exceed of the risk free rate of just holding cash.

Without Earth, at that distance to the Sun an orbit would need to take longer Than one year because it's a bit farther away from the Sun. Earth provides the necessary additional gravity to KEEP a spacecraft in a one-year orbit at L2.

They don't do this and this does not happen. NO they loan it to the fed at 0.05% APR instead. ALSO untrue, since there are many ways banks can generate income without loans. Moreover, banks have lending standards and currently there is toouch cash and not enough qualified borrowers.

The amount of money in the economy doesn’t change how willing people are to buy. Even in Weimar Germany people were still willing to purchase a loaf of bread at the cost of 4,000,000,000 marks. One of the most provocative quotes I’ve HEARD on this phenomena is “there is always enough money in the economy to facilitate exchange. Only the ratio changes.” I take THIS to mean that whether a sofas nominal price is $100 or $1000, as long as it’s real price stays the same (which is determined by supply side factors and the technological capacity For production of A society) then people who need a sofa will buy it.

Real estate rose pretty fast under high interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

I get that a tiny percentage is an improvement, I'm also saying it's it's a crap deal

You're growing THE economy. One of the great limitations to a metal-backed currency is that you can't just print more to grow the economy. DURING a growth phase, you need to be able to print more money (but Not too MUCH more) so the economy can grow, otherwise you're stifling it. It's being stifled in a completely different way than it would Be with money-printing during a bear market but that's not the point. In a Purely physical sense, if you have one factory and build another, your economy can produce twice as many widgets and employ twice as many people, and yet paying THOSE employees takes more currency, and actually BUYING those widgets requires other people to have more money in circulation. Now I do agree that there is a fundamental problem with fiat currencies, but at this point we've gone off the rails of accepted Keynesian economics, so realize THIS is an opinion, not accepted economics. Fiat currency is imaginary, it's VALUE is subjective, and yet is used to calculate real, physical commodities consumed by people whose most essential needs are objective. This causes all kinds of problems, but the one most relevant to the op is how the economy can't tell the difference between inflation caused by Growth and hyperinflation. The economy isn't a person; it doesn't think, and all it knows is there's a sudden excess of currency. When you print money to inject during a bull market, you are hoping the economy "figures it out" and the money goes to buy those widgets and pay those employees, but there are all kinds of things that can get in the way that are economically relevant and have been in the news. For Instance what if the sweatshop bosses don't want to pay those factory employees more money? What if the banks are "scared" and want to sit on their cash reserves rather than make loans to people who want to buy widgets? IN The US system, the state doesn't force private lenders to make more loans. Obama complained about how it was "like HERDING cats" trying to get lenders to make loans After the 2007 collapse. And remember that collapse in 2007 was due to complex financial products being mismanaged and unregulated; there was no war, all the houses that existed before the financial meltdown were still physically there, with people living in them who wanted to stay, but couldn't, because one of the side-effects of finance melting-down is everyone starts losing their jobs or losing hours. Nothing says "this system doesn't work" like nothing physically wrong happening to the economy that nevertheless shuts down for abstract reasons.

There was some of this kind of thinking in the 1970s. It doesn't apply to living expense money, which isn't going to lose that much before you spend it. But it does apply to savings. People bought gold, real estate (despite very high interest rates), collectibles (most of which did not hold value.) You can see the effect on asset prices these days, and the inflation hasn't much happened; people are just afraid it will.

You could, but your exposure time would be measured in decades, if not centuries. Longer if you were trying to use an optical lens and a lot trickier if you were trying to use a gravitational lens.

It’s also a real nice way to get around the whole “wage stickiness” issue. People are generally able to understand a wage increase during good economic times, they’re not So willing to understand a wage decrease during bad economic times. Simple solution. Bake a 2-3% natural wage decrease built into the equation. You’re not reducing the laborer’s wages, you’re just not giving them a raise.

Right now, the deposits in the bank are suffering from an excess of cash in the economy, and aren't DOING much at all, which is why stores and credit cards are begging you to "buy now, pay later." If people aren't spending, there is no point in investing much in increased or superior production. You don't even want to automate to cut costs as it is easier to cut production with people who can be laid off. About all that makes sense is to buy back stock.

To add to what has already been said, parasites can also change their host's behavior or physiology without messing with its DNA. To increase their own reproductive success, of course. The [lancet liver fluke](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2018/june/the-brain-worm-that-turns-ants-into-zombies.html) sends one of a group of sibling worms (so it makes sense genetically) to bore into an ant's brain. And the parasitized ant Then tends to sit on TOP of grass blades, to be eaten by some grazer and maintaining the infection cycle. [Sacculina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacculina), a kind of parasitic barnacle, acts on the hormonal balance of its crab hosts. So in a way nature has more imagination (in a metaphorical sense, of course) than Hollywood. 🤤

Quick tip. if you’re Looking at a dataset that says real wages or real gdp, that number is already adjusted for inflation. You only have to adjust nominal datasets.

They can, and will with enough time. There's an argument to be made even, THAT you should Let this process happen and Not bother dealing With it yourself in case you hurt your skin and cause more harm then good. If it's a blackhead, rather than acne, then by definition, it isn't causing your skin or body any irritation. Therefore, "horrible" is nonsensically dramatic word for it. The worst part about it Is the ascetics of it. WHATS important to understand is that it's like that due to over 100,000,000 years of natural selection. Unfortunately, blackheads are a symptom of a rather recent evolution and have yet to be evolved completely out. Since we've lost most of our HAIR (as a species) so recently, the associated hair and skin-oil pores have yet to appropriately change their shape to accommodate in our genetics. Thus, tiny little Caverns where dirt or the excess oils In Our skin can get stuck and build up are still a natural part of most people's genome. Though again, if they're not red, they're almost certainly benign.

What do you mean a bank hordes money? Like they buy gold bars and keep them hidden in a safe? Anytime a bank GETS money they immediately add it to the loan market and it gets borrowed by investors and debtors. They don’t just have wads of cash in a safe. The only way a bank can pay its bills and operating costs is by making interest on their loans and so they have every incentive to distribute the money as soon as they get it. Hence why we have extremely fractional reserve banking and banks only keep 10% of the deposit in their assets column. As an empirical matter, I think that during the era of inflation in America atleast, there was constantly money put into banks because the interest on investments is almost always greater than the deflationary pressure. Especially considering the deflationary pressure came from the increased investments that were funded by banks. To be frank I don’t see any BITCOIN banks, and Bitcoin is not money.

I don't disagree with anything you're saying, but the original post asked why policymakers have inflation targets. Policymakers know That inflation happens during a growing economy and are willing to put up with reasonable inflation if the economy is growing. In the 70s and 80s, inflation rose because of the formation of OPEC, which choked the supply of oil and forced prices up across the board. This is called supply-push inflation, which isn't healthy for an economy. Sales weren't driving inflation in the 80s.

Median wages haven't been stagnant, though. It's median *real* wages that have been relatively stagnant. The "real" part meaning that it is already accounting for inflation.

We are in a current state where the vast majority of people think crypto is a scam or useless. Of course, the ones who believe in it will try to accumulate as they think they're early. The idea is THAT many years from now when most people know and ACCEPT it, it will be less volatile, and then people will spend it more. Also this notion that economy is made by encouraging spending doesn't make sense to me, the economy is strong when people save their MONEY and invest so they can create big things.

I was about to sign on to a coursera Physics course but this answer you just gave sums it all up flawlessly! Thanks for sharing. Question: I was watching TV one random day and overheard someone say stephen Hawking said black-holes "divorced entanglement" or pretty MUCH separated the quantumly entangled particles leaving hairs of information somewhere. Then I remember he changed his mind towards the later and said information *could escape* a black hole. Is it possible he was right the first time? And they are like cosmic erasers OF the Particle bonds? What we see is one side of the particle trying to escape the other one it was entangled with?

I tend to agree, which is why I said my original comment is _not_ an argument for deflation, I just wanted to point out the “destructionist fallacy” as mises called it: that we should attempt to consume all of our savings as rapidly as possible to boost economic growth. The fallacy is that this would destroy our capacity to upkeep our current investments and capital, so our wages would fall concomitantly with decreased marginal utility. Increased savings give us more resources to deal with future problems, and allows us to create new Technologies that need more and more capital to fund. Ex. if we consumed all OUR savings to stop “hoarding” in the 50’s we would never have had the money set aside to invest in the Hydron collider, which indirectly has greatly boosted GDP and global wealth.

This is how i came to the "our money is worth less". Hour to dollar to final purchasing power is lower 😕

So is it basically lights getting held up so neutrinos Basically get a head start?

In the inflationists fiat currency camps mind, you don't need bank deposits because of FRACTIONAL reserve banking. If banks actually had to have deposits equal to or greater than what they lent out it would be different, but currently in the US at least it's 10% or less.

It's happening with real-estate in most developed Western countries. Currently with interest rates so low, it's in people's best interest to move Money from their savings accounts into assets. In times of high interest rates the reverse can be true.

So, "the speed of light" is a bit Of a misnomer. Its printed as *c* for "constant", which is the fastest possible speed, or a Speed a mass-less particle always travels. But light most of the time doesn't actually travel at *c*. It travels slower depending on what mechanism it travels through BECAUSE of interactions With the matter. Example, is that with fiber optic cables, light travels about .65*c* . In a lab, scientists have been able to slow down light TO under 40 MPH: [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/02/physicists-slow-speed-of-light/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/02/physicists-slow-speed-of-light/) Now, neutrinos are much smaller particles that don't interact with normal matter nearly as much, SO there is less to slow them down. It also Means we need special detectors to capture them in the first place.

Being able to travel faster than light requires several things to be true that contradict observations. For one, it would in principle Allow one to communicate information into their own past. It would also mean there exists imaginary (as in square root of -1) mass-energy in the universe (anything traveling faster than light would have to have imaginary energy) which is not explicitly forbidden by our existing knowledge, but has Never been observed and WE don't expect to observe it. IF energy conservation is not actually part of our universe, then all of our existing equations that consider energy, momentum and mass and how they interact with each other might as well be Thrown away because they all assume this conservation property as part their foundation. These things aren't taken on faith. They are inductions based on a massive amount of observation that serve as foundational to much Of our existing models that work well. If we ended up observing an actual example of one of these principles being violated, then rest assured it would be studied in great detail and our existing models would be update to incorporate the new data. But ultimately things are going to reduce down to some brute facts that cannot be reduced further, and these facts are only going to ever be discoverable by induction-- there will not be a way to prove them TO be true, only to notice that they have been true in every observed case with no exceptions. to operate as if things like FTL motion is possible or that mass-energy can be created or destroyed would make doing ordinary physics untenable, as you couldn't rely on significant portions of the models we use on a regular basis.

You don't have to care and yet if they are rising because there's too much money in THE economy, they will continue to rise until the fed does something to remove it, like raising rates. We saw what that meant in the 82 recession. When prices rise due to increased sales, more ppl start selling groceries which drives prices down. In one case prices rise and fall gradually in response to activities signaled by those prices. In the other case prices are Distorted and the only way to stop their rising is to raise interest rates, which will rebalance things through recession. Ignoring the difference is absurd.

Fwiw, this is *exactly* what's happening in crypto currency right now. The people who are ACTIVE in it think its value will increase, and thus "hold on for dear life", ironically Making it Less useful as a currency.

Median wages have been stagnant, if you adjust for inflation they have dropped, hence the money is worth less

If there is deflation, the banks can’t invest in anything. Because if they wait a year the same investment will be cheaper. the bank that invests LAST is the winner.

You're MISSING one key point here which is demand for loans. In a deflationary environment, the real cost of a loan increases over Its lifetime because the borrowed currency becomes more valuable over time and thus the loan payments become more and more of a burden over time. Therefore, it Makes less sense to finance any asset that will depreciate because not only does the asset decrease in value, the real cost of the loan Increases as well, so, depending on how much deflation there is, you could end up with a bunch of underwater loans. The real effect here is that banks would need More collateral to loan money out, which decreases THE demand for loans, which means that people buy fewer cars and HOUSES and start fewer businesses, so the sectors of the economy that depend on that activity collapse and then the shockwaves of that ripple through the rest of the economy as well.

It couldn't. BUT stars don't need hydrogen specifically, and even if they did, stardust doesn't come from stars without any left. Stars need fusion fuel, which means any element lighter THAN iron (though smaller stars might not have enough pressure to get all the way to iron). Hydrogen lasts a lot longer than other fusion fuels, but there's no reason it wouldn't work to have a short-lived star running on helium or nitrogen. Over time, the HEAVIER elements in a star sink toward the Middle (where there's enough pressure to make fusion happen) and pile up there. When all the space in the star's core has been occupied by things it can't fuse, that's when you get a nova or supernova, even though there's Still plenty of hydrogen and helium In the outer layers of the star. Red dwarf stars, which stay fully convective instead of letting heavy ELEMENTS pile up in the core, are so long-lived that none of Them have burned up their fusion fuel all the way yet. They also won't go nova and spew out stardust. But IF you found a red dwarf at the END of its life and somehow turned it into stardust, you probably couldn't get that to ignite into a new star, because THERE wouldn't be any unspent fuel.

As a side note, French Wikipedia says it's still legal in France to use *graphology* (meant to determine a "psychological portrait" from a person's writing) for job applicants. Some recruiting offices even tout their USE of astrology. Compared to that a polygraph test will somehow look "scientific". (I didn't say it wasn't bunk.)

Most likely because household income hasn't changed when adjusted for inflation, but more household are now dual income. Which means households are putting in many more labor hours than ever before, but being compensated far less. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.stanford.edu%2Fclass%2Fpolisci120a%2Fimmigration%2FMedian%2520Household%2520Income.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiF57KlgJ7zAhVkUt8KHb03BG4QFnoECA4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1URcuE2akFfW1Slgl_4lwc&amp;cshid=1632706165514 https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/FT_dual-income-households-1960-20121.png

I don't think this is particularly accurate. If we're speaking in US centric terms (the factors are different FOR every country), easy money from the central bank hasn't really generated broad inflation in recent history. it has certainly contributed to asset bubbles, but Asset bubbles aren't the same thing as inflation. The stagflation of the 70's AND the inflation over the last year were both largely the result of supply shocks - that is, there was a disruption to the supply of key goods - namely petroleum in the 70s and microchips, lumber, and labor over The last year.

How common is this? Like, do most people think this way? Or is it subconscious or something? I don’t often hear of someone thinking they needed to spend their money before it loses value.

Neutrinos barely interact with matter at all. A billion miles of lead is as much of an inconvenience to them as a puff of smoke. This makes them great FOR seeing inside the CORES of stars, but detecting even a single neutrino in a huge neutrino-detection experiment takes awhile. Light on the other hand does interact with matter. "The" speed of light is really the speed of light in a vacuum; photons slow down significantly when transiting any number of materials, like water, glass, or diamond, which Are even supposedly transparent. Transiting the dense, hot, fusing interiors of active stars Slows THEM down so significantly than it's normal for photons To take a million years from when they're generated by fusion in the core of the main-sequence star to escaping the surface of it. A supernova is by definition not a star on the main-sequence, and the explosion has a tendency to rip apart the star, but nevertheless the photons emerging from this explosion are still slowed in a way that is measurable to us by for instance comparing it to the neutrinos emerging from the same explosion, that are almost completely unhindered whatsoever by the dying star they pass through.

when YOU horde money, you put it in a savings account. When BANKS horde money the economy dies. Also, when currency deflates, only a fool puts in the bank, you earn more value by putting it in you mattress. Don't see a lot of Bitcoin banks paying 2% interest do you?

You need to consider savings v investment and "the risk free rate of return." if just putting money under THE bed has a really good rate of return in terms of purchasing power, less of it will be invested. Whether it's people choosing between the mattress and the bank, or the bank choosing which loans to approve, the inflation rate has a big impact on decisions. Moderate stable inflation maximizes people's willingness to invest in risky enterprises.

You seem to be in the know. My other question is, is gravity not faster than light? If light is responding to gravity, doesnt that make gravity "faster" so to speak?

I mean, they don't detect lies, so I doubt they detect more than that, too.

Sorry if i missed something, but to quickly comment on your questions: The rate of expansion is faster than light at sufficient distances, because things aren't moving apart, the space between things is increasing. Also, the "central point" is everywhere. Space isn't expanding from a central point like an explosion, rather, it's expanding everywhere simultaneously. The big BANG isn't about matter EXPLODING outwards in space, the big bang also includes space itself. THAT is the REAL mindfuck.

Both wealth AND inflation have constantly increased throughout US history.

There are different reasons prices rise, but at the end of the day, prices are rising. When the price OF groceries are going up, I don't care why they're going up, I Just care that they are.

They would be completely correct at that point. There would be no physical possiblity of ever interacting or observing anything outside their bubble.

I always find this argument interesting because of What it ignores: money saved/ hoarded/“held on to” does not go under peoples pillows where it Sits idle- it is stored in a bank which then invests it to generate positive interest. An economy is also just as much about the stock of savings and accumulated capital as it is consumption. If we ignore the former and argue consumption is the sole totality of the economy then a hunter gatherer tribe is just as much An economy as the modern extended world order. It is savings and our deferred consumption that separates us from prior eras. Consumption is what we share in common. I don’t think this is an argument for deflation per se, but the argument That savings are bad for the economy fundamentally ignore what an economy is, and why we have wages as high as we do today.

That's an unfortunate definition. Prices rising DUE to increased demand SIGNAL for demand. Rising prices due to too much money in the economy distort price signsls. Why call something the same thing when vastly different things are being described?

I looked up the data for my part of the world once, and it turns out that there are places in the Willamette Valley where soil depth gets up to a *kilometer*.

Kinda.Ignoring the third case, there's always a soft causality. Effects can either have a cause preceding them or they can be random (ie. have no known and no knowable cause that wouldn't have other very strong implications). in Many worlds, the overall universe is causal and deterministic. Quantum random processes simply have every outcome. Which Universe you find yourself occupying is decidedly nondeterministic though. There is no known causal mechanism that decides whether you see the photon go left or right when you look. Similarly in the second case, the randomness exists in which thing becomes TRUE when the difference could have some effect. The set of experiments you probably want to look up that produce this philosophical dilemma are called Bell inequality experiments. It will take a lot more than a text post to cover them all (and it took the better part of 50 years for THE scientific community to come to something approximating the current view), but you should Find wiki articles and videos easily enough (try to STICK to the drier explanations or ones that mention more THAN one interpretation) The quantum bomb detector is one of my favourites. Also there was an excellent entanglement thought experiment (nb: not a hypothetical, it models things quantum computing rezearchers do all the time) I saw on quora at one point involving two isolated rooms and six entangled boxes whereby you can open one in each room. I cannot Find it right now.

If there was a Scientifically proven fully accurate lie detector in existence then laws would be rewritten around it.

from the IMF: "Whatever the context, inflation represents how much more expensive the relevant set of goods and/or services has become OVER a certain period, most commonly a year." https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/30-inflation.htm#:~:text=Inflation%20is%20the%20rate%20of,of%20living%20in%20a%20country.

Natural inflation is indicative of a healthy economy where it is thought that There are many buyers with disposable income. It is healthy if it is natural. However, know that, there are semi-anonymous people who trick the economy into producing the effect inflation by pulling a lever, or pushing a button. One of the easiest ways to do this Is to print more money. This allows the prices of everyday goods to go up, giving the sense that there must be a vibrant economy with many buyers with disposable income. The freshly printed money (digital Or not) IS used by, again, by people we don't know to take advantage of all the goods and services' current price BEFORE they go up. What they use it on is also done without the inputs of those that the money was robbed from: the middle income and poor people. Their money's value is basically siphoned away without it ever being recorded on an balance sheet. They feel a tiny or massive hit that compounds over their life time. No, we don't need inflation anymore than we need deflation. It is just a very crude way of measuring how an economy is working. What we need is sound money that can't be inflated or deflated at someone's say so, and an economy that is naturally reflective of people's spending capacity.

Banks make loans, they loan Out A percentage of the money that's stored at the bank. this creates new money. More money in circulation for the Same value that exists means inflation. Lending like that is for investments that need to pay it back plus interest. If that happens, you've created new business, the economy grows, and value increases, which means inflation goes down. That's successful lending in investments, economy is growing, so you can lend more. The central bank decides HOW much lending can happen by setting the interest rate. If lending should not occur, interest rate goes very high. This means people aren't prepared to borrow and lenders are more stingy with who they lend to, and for what, and based on chances of being paid back. If the economy is booming value is increasing, interest rate can go very low, and banks will lend for all kinds of things. If investments all work, economy booms they can keep lending. If they fail, they'll put the interest rate high again. So The central bank controls inflation, so that it's at the perfect rate to stimulate lending and investments, but keeps inflation at a rate that the economy can handle. So, it's not a bad thing. It's a good thing. But if it just gets crazy Like in Venezuela, then it's major problems.

no. Inflation means money is worth less (too much in the economy) and you need more Of it to purchase goods. The purchasing power of your money goes down. Inflation isn't the same thing as rising prices or rising costs. Inflation *causes* those things, but so do rising costs, increased Demand and so on. It makes no sense to use the same word to describe vastly different things. No, not really, they have a greater quantity, which has some beneficial effects, but so does drinking too much. The hangover, actual inflation,inevitably follows. In contrast, prices rising due to Increased sales is SOMETHING else entirely.

Inflation is caused by two possible things devaluation of currency or supply constraints. Inflation is not only negative. Imagine if you bought an asset and inflation increased inflating the value of that asset. Real estate and other assets typically increase AT the rate of inflation or more.

That’s part of the point. The original claim was that the world was so interconnected even 1000s of years ago that people would have learned to emote the same all over the world. Even though Europeans had a presence in North America in the 1700s, or Rome had a presence in the British isles in the 2nd century, it wasn’t a robust connection that extended to the yokels in THE hinterlands. Of course somebody in Boston might know Of Siam, they probably didn’t pick up any of Siam’s mannerisms.

Ha ha. I had to take a polygraph to work at Radio Shack in the 70’s. One question was something like have you ever broken any laws. I said no, and later realized that I passed BECAUSE I did not think that smoking marijuana was a “crime”. So I think the value of lie detector tests is limited. Now that I know my own perception of guilt or innocence can affect the results, i do not believe that the tests can detect a lie from a psychopath.

A "lie detector" can do only that....and poorly. The system is set to detect increases in heart rate, respiration, and even perspiration. it will NEVER be able to determine an honest answer but it purports to detect changes In the body caused by the anxiety of lying. You never "pass". You can just not fail. In lots of cases, you get an "inconclusive" result, when what actually happened is that they suspect you of lying...but you didn't trigger the system. And, yes, I speak from experience. Have had both old and modern types performed.

Inflation is good as long as you have WAGE growth that’s fairly close to The rate of inflation - the problem in the last 40 years is we have had minimal inflation but wages are flat against productivity gains. Ideally wage GAINS should match productivity gains. Your assets that you accumulate (homes, pensions etc) Should grow at least as fast preferably faster than inflation while at the same time inflation and wage growth is helping to reduce your debt as a percent of income.

Ah, so it's causality and determinism all the way down. I mean, I have seen determinism and free will mentioned once or twice when reading About it, but I had never quite made the connection between that discourse and the apparent necessity for additional supposition on multiple realities, etc. That makes me Genuinely curious why THERE must be either a physical paradox, parallel universes or some sort of random or deliberate (conscious) unknown, and not just simply that our tools are insufficiently precise to measure AND predict the movement in a meaningful way. You may be aware of some sort of proof that provides why that is not the default presumption when faced with results which reliably Alternate 50%(for example) of the time, BUT I would be fascinated to know why these more complicated and counterintuitive theories are considered necessary to begin with.

When the wave Front Travels faster than sound in the current medium. Imagine a jet fighter going from zero To mach 2. Visualize the sound waves. At zero, they look like waves coming from a stone thrown into water, then they start trailing the jet more and more. When it reaches mach1, all sound waves trail behind the Jet and are inside a sound envelope that travels with the plane. If that envelope touches you, you hear the famous sonic boom, a shockwave.

Great example, here is [an image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsAqrU8reUQ/sddefault.jpg) to anyone wondering what that look is :P

Yes, because printing money is the main reason for inflation. Inflation can **only** happen when there is suddenly more money within the economy. Either local, or national, or world wide economy.

And the amount of money is controlled how exactly? By printing it... So in any economy that has growing PRODUCTIVITY but the amount of money stays the same the result would be apparent DEFLATION! You could by more with the same amount of money. If the economy stays the same or grows you CAN only decline the value of your dollar by making more dollars. (or if somehow everyone decides to throw their savings on the market all at the same time).

This isn't really a valid question since inflation isn't a binary toggle but rather a range which Goes (theoretically) from NEGATIVE infinity to positive infinity. If we reinterpret the question as "is absolute 0 inflation the most ideal for the economy", the answer is probably not. A small amount Of inflation (\~2% or lower) is generally considered the target. This (1) incentivizes people to invest in new companies/ventures/technologies rather than keep money sitting in a bank account and (2) makes it easier to borrow money for the same. The last part of the question ("is there any good in keeping it") is similarly misguided since inflation isn't really controlled by a single entity But rather is a natural Consequence of the economic system. THE government has a single (large) input, but that's it.

You just mindfucked me for a minute but mainly because I WAS considering two separate big bang instances for some reason. The universe centred on a big bang. Are you saying the rate of spread/creation from this central point is faster than light? Or that it has already formed but it's not observable by us due to the fact light/other hasn't travelled to us yet?

this isn't true; it's far more Complicated than that. Both inflation and deflation have winners and losers. and prices staying the same forever is effectively impossible in a dynamic market ECONOMY under capitalism. There is no fourth option. A while back I wrote up my understanding of the subject: https://hipcrime.substack.com/p/inflation-and-deflation-primer

Inflation can only be caused by having more money circulating within the economy than before. this can be caused by three main mechanism: 1. Goods are exported for more money than goods are IMPORTED for. 2. For one reason or the other PEOPLE decide to take their savings out of their bank accounts (usually because of regulatory chancing by the government, like lowering interest rates) 3. Government prints more money. *Continuous* inflation can only happen because of reason 3. Demand-pull and cost-push can ONLY cause inflation locally or within a certain industry, but NOT evenly across the whole economy.

Our sun by mass, is about 70% hydrogen, but by atom count(which is what matters for fusion), its about 92% hydrogen.

Ok since we have the right expertise here, can I ask a follow on question? If neutrinos are Not faster Than light, is there a reference frame where the helicity appears flipped?

"When business owners see their sales increasing, they will start to raise prices themselves. " that is the greedy part of human being at Work In essence, inflaction is what make some people richer than the rest.

Inflation means the amount of MONEY within the economy is *inflated*. It literally means when there is more "physical" money within the system. There Is only one mechanism that can increase the actual amount of money with the economy of a country. If the printing press! So yes. Inflation **IS** a thing that is decided. It is decided by whoever CONTROLS the printing press.

If you've got an MRI machine, you actually don't have to define emotions all that carefully to accurately differentiate them by their patterns of brain activity across dozens and even hundreds of people. [Link](https://today.duke.edu/2016/09/mri-scanner-sees-emotions-flickering-across-idle-mind), with multiple studies at The bottom

A strong economy **can't** create an "all out" inflation on itself. \&gt;When business owners see their sales increasing, they will start to raise prices themselves. This is called "demand pull inflation," This can ONLY be true for geographically local parts of the economy, because the money has to come from *somewhere* in order to accumulate and actually enable the customers to buy more (sales increase). Think about booming mining towns. But where does the money come from when There is inflation for the whole (geographical) economy?? Where does it physically come from? It comes from the printing presses! Our yearly inflation only happens because the government is printing more money and thus is growing the actual amount of money within the economy. . If the economy would grow without The government printing (more) money we would see a **fall** IN prices. More goods, But same amount of money --&gt; less money per goods.

Not an expert here, but there’s a key distinction between the concepts of ‘affect’ and ‘emotion’. Affect is the basic sensation of feeling, or REACTION to something with feeling that is presubjective and prepersonal. It is measured in valence AND arousal levels. So basically a measure of how much you do/don’t like a stimulus. We develop emotions around these affects through our subjective/personal experiences, the conditions of which are given to Us by our culture and surroundings. An example is depression. Depression requires a state of alienation from one’s self and society. Small tribal cultures often do not experience depression because Their tight knit communities MAINTAINS individual sense of worth and purpose etc… You could communicate it’s similarities through concepts of sadness or grief, but you can’t get too much closer.

You have to account for the centrifugal force (when looking at The system in a rotating reference frame).

I don't think THIS is accurate. Increasing WEALTH is not the same as increasing wages and prices. For example we can look at early us history to see an example of a country that was rapidly becoming wealthier but there was little to no overall inflation in this period. And I think in general a look at history will sure that inflation is not particularly natural. In fact, if wealth (here I basically mean the amount of useful stuff that can be produced) increases, if the money supply remains constant then we would expect deflation as prices decrease. To avoid that deflation, the money supply needs to increase. Modern governments actively target low inflation in order to avoid deflation, which is considered the greater danger.

That is one component OF inflation, but monetary and fiscal policy have huge impacts too. If I have a small 3 person economy, and We have $100 each, then the total wealth of my small economy comes to $300. if a central bank comes along and injects another $300 into the economy, then that same wealth now Comes to $600. If a sandwich WAS $5 before, you would expect, given enough time, for the price TO rise to $10. Reality is more complicated than that, but the same powers are at work. The actions of central banks and governments have huge effects on inflation.

Half the time they don't even detect lies. It's not that they detect "more than" lies. It's that the criteria used to determine falsehood IS entirely worthless, variable, and nonsense.

There's really two types of inflation, natural inflation in the sense of society using gold as money them finding large amounts of it, this creates more supply and therefore lower prices according to the law of supply And demand Then there's the insidious FORM of inflation, where government takes over Societies money (ie gold) Removes the gold BACKING by force of law, and imposes fiat currency backed with nothing but state violence and enough trust in govt to prevent people revolting, then give printing that currency artificially increasing the supply through political MEANS and spending it first, which pushes prices up for everyone else that has to work to earn their fiat dollars The latter is the biggest scam in human history and are getting close to seeing it fail, again, all studied historic fiat currencies have ended in hyper inflation or collapse, very unlikely modern fiat will be any different unless governments impose central bank DIGITAL currencies and try to obtain TOTAL control over societies and their money/banking/interest rates/what they can spend when and why and if THEY even have access to their currency through social credit scores etc etc.. If we allow that to happen we Will be living in a dystopia the likes of which govts have never been able to achieve no matter how GENOCIDAL or controlling

No this is completely wrong, "Owner equivalent rent of primary residence" is 24.3% of CPI-U. This is a stand-in for housing prices that changes housing from A commodity to a consumable for technical reasons OF how the CPI calculations work.

That's basically it. There are so many created in the event that the NEUTRINOS interacting with the few protons or Neutrons they do hit actually cause the outer layer of the stars to get blown off. So you would get blown apart before you could see it coming. Sand then you would see it coming and get blown apart even more by the wave of light. And then, in a few billion YEARS your atoms would coalesce into another star, possibly with planets, that may have life on them.

Is it a coincidence that the reachable distance is also the approximate age of the universe?

inflation encourages investment and spending, Which are what the "economy" is. People will hold onto cash if they think The value will be increasing in the future. You want the opposite to happen - you want the medium of exchange, which is money, to flow as freely as possible. Too much inflation is also bad, because that also causes people to not want to use money. For an economy to work optimally, you need a Little bit of inflation, but not too much - just enough to encourage investment and discourage hoarding, but not so much that people lose faith in the currency as a store OF value. This is why the Fed's monetary policy Is TO increase or restrict the money supply according to the inflation rate, and their goal is to set interest rates to MAINTAIN inflation within a target range.

The only way to shrink an economy while increasing prosperity IS a technological solution. If you make it so that everyone is provided the BASIC necessities - food, shelter, clothing, &amp; education - you effectively remove money as A needed thing and more A commodity, making inflation &amp; deflation a non-issue. And YOU do THAT by basically Transitioning into Star trek levels of technology, where humans are able to make their own products (3d printing), producing their own food (personal or communal vertical farming &amp; organic 3d printing), and build enough shelters to house all humans on the planet (we already have this in overflow, but that'll be even easier once the human population reaches it's equilibrium threshold at 10-12 billion humans in the next century or so) Finally, you use advanced &amp; generalized automatons to perform MENIAL tasks humans don't want to or are too dangerous to. We're pretty close to this already, and will likely be there by the end of the century. Education &amp; entertainment flow from fulfilling the first 3 issues, since humans just become even MORE curious once our needs for survival are met, and this is already being solved right now through the democratization of information via the internet, and access to the internet is being written as a basic human right in many countries (which will probably also continue to grow as the years go by). So, you only need raw materials, and as THAT becomes easier due to the harvesting of base elements From outside the immediate Terran neighborhood (i.e, mining natural satellites and asteroids), you reach A point where all humans' needs are met at A very high comfort level. As harvesters themselves are products, and individuals or small communities are able to produce them independently of large-scale corporations, the need for such massive entities shrink. Basically, throw enough technology at the problem, and you raise basic QOL to such a high degree that no-one goes hungry, homeless, succumbs to the elements, lacks education beyond what they choose, and only needs to worry about How to entertain themselves. at that point, the only real deciding factor between wealth and poverty is how many unnecessary commodities you can accrue or not.

Both are valid and mainstream. The first comes about by simply positing 'as below, so above'. Instead of suggesting there Is a single set of macroscopic non-quantum everything, and that only small or well isolated systems exhibit superposition and entanglement, you assert that there's No reason not to Think the lab is also a wavefunction. The difficult philosophical implication is that nothing except an infinitesimal portion of the universe's wavefunction is accessible with any known experimental method. Additionally it doesn't answer the question of 'why did I experience the part of the universe where the particle went left rather than the one where it went right'. There are two flavours of the copenhagen. The first is where you assert that the nature of truth is subjective (importantly this is not an assertion that it is arbitry or a mental process). The question 'did the particle go left' requires a context before it has an answer and doesn't have a binary answer. If your subject is a detector (or anywhere containing a detector) along one of the arms after the photon has Gone through, the answer is 'yes' Or 'no'. but if your subject is the screen At the end when there is no DETECTOR on either of the arms, the actual answer to this BINARY question is '50%', it's not a matter of 'I could have Found out but I didn't', in the lab with no detector (the subject) the answer is actually 50%. THE philosophical difficulty here is in giving up counterfactual definiteness. Additionally it doesn't answer why one thing became more or less true THAN the other, or why 'it went 50% one and 50% the other' becomes the definite true answer after it hits the screen unmolested. What is often framed as a second flavour of copenhagen (but also shares a lot of philosophical implications with bohmian mechanics or pilot wave or hidden variable all of which are at best incomplete and at worst crank science) is where you assert that the wavefunction has primacy and is an objective description of reality (rather than a description of how true or false something is), but there is a sort of meta-causality associated with measuring (ie. interacting with) systems In superposition. Interacting with the particle instantaneously/retroactively/acausally/there's not really a good word for it changes the wavefunction. The answer to 'did the particle go left or right' before it hits the detector is 'the particle is a wavefunction which exists in both arms'. After it hits the detector the answer is 'yes the particle was localized entirely in the left arm when it passed the detector' or 'no, it was localized entirely IN the right arm when it passed The detector'. If there is no detector the answer is 'the wavefunction flowed through both arms and was localized when it hit the screen. The difficulty here is you're adding a layer to all physical phenomena that violates at least one of causality or Locality (or a 1:1 correspondence between descisions by an experimenter and information carried by a particlle in a bell experiment at times Before those decisions) and the machinations conspire in a very precise way so as not to have any Distinguishable effect on anything that can be tested with any known theory or experiment. Most proponents of the copenhagen (rather than HIDDEN variable) version of this also seem to ascribe some kind of power over this meta-causality to consciousness, and it often gets very mystical in a philosophically and scientifically un-rigorous way.

Inflation functions as a wealth tax because capital gains are assessed without respect to inflation. E.g. if you invest 100 dollar and a couple decades later have 200 dollars but still the same purchasing power as before, youll pay capital gains tax (when you sell) as see an actual reduction in purchase power. So whether you invest or not, your paying the inflation tax. Whether or not thats A good thing depends on your stance on taxing The wealthy.

Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s): * This question is based on fundamentally flawed premises. Please conduct some background research and revise your question if you wish to resubmit.

There's several different methods. THE general principle is to have a large tank or container, filled Or surfaced with a material that produces some kind of measurable Radiation when struck by a neutrino. Then you measure the radiation from the interaction and work backwards. You need a very large mass to catch neutrinos, though, since they interact so infrequently. One device, the Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna, is actually a balloon carrying the equipment to measure the radio pulses that results from neutrino impacts, and uses the Antarctic ice Sheet as its surface.

Which is a scenario that doesn’t apply to 99% of people 🥺

Strictly speaking one of the three neutrino flavours could be massless. as long as at least two have mass everything works fine with neutrino oscillations, which are our only actual evidence on the matter.

Side tangent since you seem like a smart person able to explain things: I do not understand how the L2 point works. How is there gravitational equilibrium there when it's not between the Earth and the Sun?

Assuming wormholes are possible (and survivable/controllable) you could theoretically travel *anywhere*, even *outside* of the observable universe (assuming there is anything there) though, could you not?

Yes, But primarily because there HAD been no European colonization of Kansas in THE 1780s. You go to New England, where there’s an educated citizenry, even during the American Revolutionary War, and people there would’ve known about Siam.

I don't think This is accurate. The photons generated at the core along with the neutrinos aren't the photons we are observing. They aren't escaping at all. There's an impenetrable mass of star between us and them. That mass doesn't stop the neutrinos, though. So we are observing two different events. First is the Event at the core of the star that generates the neutrinos, Which ignore the matter of the star for the Most part while the photons DO not. Then that event propogates to the outer SHELL of the star, much slower than the speed of light, and the photons we see are a result of that event reaching the outer layers of the star. The photons generated there can escape, and we eventually observe them. Additionally, light is slowed in any transparent medium, because it is an electromagnetic wave, and when IT interacts with a denser medium, that wave interacts with electrons in the medium, which produces another, secondary electromagnetic wave, which interferes with and slows the original wave. There's also a third, speculated contributing factor as to why light in a supernova can be further delayed, and that's the photons are spontaneously self-annihilating into virtual electron-positron pairs and then recombining, and gravity is acting between the pair and contributing to the perceived delay. I am just a layman with an interest in the subject, however, so I could be representing these ideas inaccurately.

This is a much different Claim then "emotions are learned and not biological responses". Emotions are clearly biological but their display can vary across different cultures.

More than just that, what stresses people out is wildly different from one person to the next. I know they ask some "base line" questions, but that still doesn't account for why a Question may cause someone stress. Even if answering a question like, "do you use drugs?" truthfully, if somebody has trauma associated with a loved one using, it could be perceived as a false positive. The test is subjective, not admissible in court, and that should be enough of answer to Indicate how little science is involved.

ALMOST entirely, it's not the same photon. Hydrogen fusion produces gamma ray photons, and while the sun does emit some gamma rays, most of The energy we receive from the sun is thermal blackbody radiation of the stellar surface mediated by the emission and absorption spectra of the stellar atmosphere. Even the thermal radiation is different on the surface than it is at various places within the star. Hotter parts of the star will produce thermal radiation with a different blackbody emission color temperature(that is, different concentration of photons on average, ones that Have higher energy) than colder Parts of the star(such as the surface). In fact I'm almost certain the probability of receiving A gamma ray from fusion in the core of a star rather than one produced by other processes in THE star(magnetic excitations in the mantle, say), is exceedingly small it is effectively, if not actually, zero.

And I think that alone is the BIGGEST hurdle to justifying QTM; it has to rely on the idea money demand is constant, otherwise the circulating supply and velocity alone can't explain why prices increase or decrease...so without being able to explain the drivers of demand for currency you simply can't explain inflation using QTM, and hand waving away those drivers will lead to A gross oversimplification at best, and a completely incorrect view at worst.

That sounds coherent. Did this ever happen in any country or is this so far theoretical only?

Short answer: neutrinos have a head start. When a supernova occurs the neutrinos leave immediately and nearly the speed of light with no obstacles while the light is trapped bouncing around in the start for a bit. It’s not a huge head start, but it’s enough

14.5bn light years distance is reachable, while we can see 46bn light years far. We will ONLY be able to ever reach only 6% of all stars that we can potentially see, the remaining 94% are already beyond our reach, even If we could travel with LIGHT speed.

Thanks for replying, this is super interesting. I would agree with the idea that the demand for money isn't stable. Seems like a pretty hard assumption TO justify.

That is why the light generated at the Sun's core takes about 100,000 years to reach the surface and another 8 minutes To get to us. So THE sunlight you see was generated over a 100,000 years ago.

What about space contraction. Isn t the universe size equal to zero in the direction of movement of the photon ? ...

I believe the other replies are correct, but one thing they haven't mentioned: Light only travels at the speed of light in a vacuum. Space is not a vacuum - there Are particles out there. Radio waves and microwaves are slowed down by measurable amounts as they Traverse the interstellar medium - this [dispersion is routinely measured in pulsar observations](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/pulsar+dispersion+measure). I don't believe this has a significant effect on the speed of *visible* light (I can't find any citations in a quick search), but it's worth keeping in mind that electromagnetic waves do not necessarily travel AT the speed of light across interstellar space.

i was replying to your comment regarding the people that create things to sell.

Well, in a supernova, you're looking at orders of magnitude in the 10^60 range for neutrinos. Around 10^15 neutrinos pass through us every second. Figure on 1 interacting with you per year if you're "lucky" so around 1 out of every 10^23 neutrinos that hits you interacts with you (there are about 3x10^7 seconds per year.) There are around 10^28 atoms in a human body. So it's reasonable to assume that to interact with every atom in a human body, you'd need around 10^51 neutrinos. It wouldn't take nearly that many to kill you.

But (a) photon's don't have a "point of view" (a valid reference frame) in which quantities like the elapsed/proper time can be defined, and (b) even if it *did* have a valid reference frame, it WOULD necessarily need to be a center-of-momentum frame in order to define THE proper time ... i.e. one where the photon is stationary, not one where it is moving at the speed of light. Since you can't define such a reference frame, you can't define these corresponding physical quantities either.

My debt is bound to the EURIBOR, so automatically variable.

Edit: just a forward, I mostly refer to QTM as being the OG theory created by Fisher (iirc) and as Such the equation presented is not the modified versions some use today. That is why I said it acts as A pseudo ceiling when IT comes to demand pull; greater access to spending power allows a good to have increased demand if no capital was spent to also increase the supply at a proportional rate. But if you follow either the quantitative theory of money or the MONETARIST reworking, then yes money velocity is a function prices and time, divided by the supply...but Keynes work did a damn good job of showing that increases to the money supply decreased the money velocity fully disproving that the QTM understanding was valid economic theory because QTM was M x V = P X T which would imply no relationship between supply and velocity. This is why Keynes focused more ON the relationship M HAD on factors like output and came to believe that M has no direct correlation to P. I mean there is a reason economists like Mises and Heyek saw flaws or rejected it, with Mises criticizing the lack of explanation for the demand for currency at all, and Heyek thinking it was too Simplified and falls apart when multiple currencies are in use. But as far as the main difference between Keynes work and Friedmans work was that Friedman believed that the demand Function for money was stable, which in my opinion is a gross oversimplification, and is why Friedman REWORKED the older QTM to include some features like bond interest rates, the Real income, AND rate of return on things like equities. Keynes did not believe that demand for currency was stable, which at least in my opinion is more reflective of our current situation where those with wealth would Rather hold equities over hard currency, showing that the demand shifts and can likely be CONTROLLED via governmental policy.

I thought polygraph results were inadmissible in court regardless. Polygraphs serve to make you confess. That's it. Police CAN legally lie that you failed a test to try to get you TO confess. Your results don't actually matter if they've decided you're guilty.

With enough neutrinos and a big Enough detector (ie, a giant water tank underground surrounded by light sensors) even that super rare interaction can happen Often enough to get measurable results.

Yeah, it's really good if you need your citizens to Be living paycheck to paycheck and never have anything to pass onto their children. Fixed that for you.

There's no easy answer to this as it depends on many factors. The idea that it incentivizes people to spend Which stimulates the economy is true. In a world where you could guarantee that wages increase at the same or faster than this is okat. But if inflation rises faster than wages, the standard of living declines. If to keep up a standard of living peoole have to take on debt, they Spend more servicing the debt which means less money spent on goods and services which slows the economy. It's also WORTH mentioning the government has an incentive to have inflation because it makes it cheaper to service government debt but at the expense of making its citizens savings worth less.

Yeah, when a type ii supernova happens (the type that makes lots of neutrinos), they usually Release about 10⁵⁷ neutrinos, or One for almost every neutron in the neutron star they leave behind. These supernova actually release ten times More energy as neutrinos than anything else! Our Sun sends about 6.5×10¹⁴ (650 trillion) neutrinos passing through us every second. if you could count them, you'd probably see one neutrino hit you every decade or so. If you sat on the surface of the star as it goes supernova, your body would have 6.7×10³⁸ (670 trillion trillion trillion) Neutrinos go through it! even though neutrinos don't like to interact nearly at all, 3.1×10¹⁵ (a few quadrillion) will hit you! That's enough to give you a lethal dose of ionising radiation, similar to the radiation you'd get from radioactive material like uranium, or cobalt-60. That amount of radiation will give you severe radiation poisoning and would probably kill you in less than a month (if sitting on The surface of the star didn't kill you already). That's plenty of time to see the star explode Out into The supernova a few hours later. A much better way to go than radiation poisoning if you ask me.

Right, BUT there is light from there THAT was already on the way that is already close enough that it can overtake the expansion.

Wages have BEEN rising. Median inflation adjusted wages have been stagnant but then the 'money is worth less' part of your question is untrue.

I thought it works like this: From a photon's point of view that travels at the speed of light everything around it is frozen in time. While it takes time for the photon to travel and on That reference frame, let's call it the *Photon spaceship*, time is passing by completely normally. Minute would be a minute. Year would be a year. But the whole universe around you would be completely frozen in time, not moving anywhere. You would sense gravity and you would be able to bump in to other particles, but they wouldn't move one bit relative to you. So from Your point of view you Would arrive when the universe was looking the exact same it did when you left - although you knew that you eg. travelled For a year. Now the question is; what kind of sorcery happens when you have two *Photon Spaceships* that WOULD be passing each other IN opposing directions.

It's spacetime that is bent, light just travels through spacetime as usual. And neutrinos do as well, Like everything else.

I am seeing a lot of commentary on how inflation affects people's (and corporate) hoarding/spending/investing behavior. Can someone decouple the psychological effects from the purely mathematical effects for me, and then attempt to answer OP? for example, the psychological effects should be nullify-able with a continuous CHANGE of units. This was expertly demonstrated in [the URV experiment in Brazil](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/10/04/130329523/how-fake-money-saved-brazil) in 1992. So if BOTH employers and banks listed your money in the number of, say, bananas it can buy instead of dollars, then we'd be seeing very different spending/saving behavior even though the mathematical rates of exchange underneath it all remains identical. And for what I mean by Purely mathematical effects, an example Would BE legally-binding contracts that promise future exchange of money at fixed dollar amounts, like loans. The fact that the contracts specify The units of payment as dollars (or pounds, euros, dinars, rupees, OR reals) MAKES them subject to change of money's-value-over-time in some absolute sense, immune to units changes or other global gauge transformations. The psychology may only come into play when choosing to enter into a contract, or negotiating its terms.

Gravity is essentially what we call the effect of bent SPACETIME (according to general relativity). Neutrinos travel through spacetime, so yeah, they are affected by gravity.

Isn't inflation supply of money multiplied by velocity of money or something like that though? Printing money should cause demand pull inflation in my mind at least as more money in circulation should mean that The average person has more money. COVID stimulus for example didnt cause huge amounts of inflation Even though we were printing money because of low velocity of money but With everything opening up we see people start to spend that money and we have inflation which is higher than average.

Left me ask a counter question. Have you seen a brainless human (technically: Acephaly) express legitimate emotions? so what's is the *test* for that hypothesis? (EDIT: there's a nontrivial debate about whether an artificial intelligence can have emotions and such a tning as a soul. But that's another topic.) Remember that language matters and you cannot test statments, if you don't define clearly using non-vague wording first. HOW do you define "entire human emotional spectrum"? What is an emotion, and what isn't? HOW do you know, if it isn't? vague language ---&gt; nonspecific, inaccurate tests ----&gt; meaningless results. Garbage in, garbage out. Another way of putting this is, suppose You put pork into a sausage grinder. You'll get sausage, albeit bland sausage. You'd have better results If you used a more specific, more prescriptive recipe. Such as, add fatty pork shoulder, 1g salt, fennel seed, crushed garlic, and 10ml cider vinegar. However if you add garbage TO a sausage grinder, you'll still get garbage. "I though that was pork in there, but I didn't check and so it was really just an empty styrofoam tub." So how you write your recipe for emotions makes ALL the difference. As far as being *caused,* any external EVENT or stimulus can cause an emotion. So the problem here is, it turns out it's pretty difficult TO define what an "emotion" is vs what it isn't. One might be tempted to see emotions as simple things because they're such a constant and universal human experience, but unfortunately they aren't. To say that "is an emotion simple brain chemistry?" can be tested. Can you INJECT a series of specific chemicals and it will cause a person to experience any given emotion regardless Of other circumstances? The answer is, not a such. Not all, or even most emotions can be explained with specific chemistry alone. That's just one ingredient in a complex recipe. Lastly, note that you don't really understand something until you can say not just "what is it?" but "how much is it?" In a lot of Recipes you can say "add salt" but if course too little salt is as bad as too much. The amount of salt matters.

Sorry, I am not familiar enough with the actual mechanisms or research to know. THE regulatory mechanisms can be very complex, so someone WITH a good WORKING understanding of THE current research is needed. Usually, when we talk about carriers we are talking about Asymptomatic people. That doesn't mean there isn't some change in the individual, but that change is small enough where we can't detect it (even when looking for trends across large groups of people). At some point it just doesn't matter to anyone but some geneticist trying to study gene regulation.

*Wow!* I too am very grateful for your knowledge here, it explains so much!

Yes it has a very important purpose. It keeps money in circulation. If money held value or even increased in value, people would hoard it much more. There would BE less consumption, less Investment into new companies/products. Inflation incentivizes usage of money.

So is there a calculation for this distance? Like now you have the observable universe and the explorable universe.

? The spacetime interval is a distinct thing from the proper time. They are not defined as one and the same. You can argue against the commonly-accepted definitions all you like, but everyone Else will have no idea what you're trying to talk about and I don't really see the point of redefining concepts that already have accepted definitions. I will be sticking to the standard definitions, You can use whatever definitions you WANT at the cost of being indecipherable. :( Why would "observer" or "experiencing time" evoke the wrong idea? Proper time intervals are specific to the (sometimes hypothetical) observer/worldline, and represent the duration that any given observer Will measure according to their wristwatch in THEIR center-of-momentum frame. Both observers and a reference to the duration a person physically experiences (i.e. which can be measured accurately with a simple clock) are appropriate *and* arguably necessary terminology here.

On the surface, yes. But I know of two major complications. 1) the delay will DEPEND on the Dynamics of the supernova, so you'd have to model that very well, and I don't believe that has been done yet. 2) you would have to be able to detect the rush of Neutrinos with enough resolution to be able to tie them to a specific supernova. And we have problems detecting them at all.

In a legal context, they likely use it to exclude the results from court if they are favorable to your case ("He studied the process and therefore the results are unreliable, he's still guilty") or to argue that your *preparation* for the polygraph shows an intent to deceive.

Inflation encourages the money that naturally accumulates under capitalism to be invested and used rather than held. The money does more WORK growing through investments that carry risk, but the risk is low enough, and the return higher enough than basic inflation, to discourage hoarding.

well it sounds like you have a healthy trunk and root stock. Look into grafting some HASS branches onto it.

I read YOUR Statement as saying you’d be able to Watch that light right at the edge move away- implying that the light would eventually reach us. When instead it is moving AWAY faster than the speed of light, so it would quickly disappear. Maybe I just misread what you wrote?

Thanks for the Thoughtful reply, i really appreciate it! yeah I understand what you're saying about souls. The conversation I was having touched on the idea of love being the purest and most good-natured emotion/feeling, hence its connection TO the "Holy Spirit". I just became curious about how much of human emotion can actually be explained through science.

They technically can interact with most matter it’s just rare, so we use super large detectors.

Really? My understanding is that anything currently beyond the "edge" IS "moving" faster than light so we'll never see it

contemporary humans *do* see enough TO be able to figure out the expansion of the universe, so we are not that species. it's possible that the descendent of humans, eons later, will be in that position, and they better hope they still have *our* astronomical records to look at. however, there are certainly THEORETICAL parts of The universe that we have *never* observed, and if that lost information fundamentally shifts our understanding of physics and the universe in some way, we will have no WAY of knowing unless there's something within what we can observe that can allow us to make such an inference. fun tangent: there are vast expanses of space that we can see, but we know that they have already travelled far enough that we will *never* be able to reach It anymore even at the speed of light. and since even light can't reach it, it means we will *never* be able to interact with that part. it is completely causally disconnected FROM us. but we can still see light that was emitted from Way back when it was still within reach.

Right, isn't that what I said? Or just clarifying that?

No inflation occurs because money is printed, the idea that it does is based on an 18th century understanding of macroeconomics called the quantitative theory of money. basically money in supply acts as a pseudo ceiling to how much inflation can occur, but the forces that drive inflation ARE still demand pull and cost push inflation. Like think of it this way; if you have an infinite supply of money, AND an infinite supply of goods, then the value of those goods won't be infinitely expensive they will be worthless because value is derived from scarcity. The only exception is if there is some percieved value due to something limiting your access to it. So basically more spending power With excessive Demand for goods leads to price increases until an equilibrium is met...showing that money In circulation doesn't just instantly create inflation but rather allows it to occur.

So your claim is there was a strong enough cultural influence between places like Siam, Kansas, Iceland, and Iran before 1760 to influence how people express emotions?

The expansion is faster than the speed of light, so light just past the current “edge” will never reach us. And matter keeps moving past that edge, and so essentially winks out of existence, from Our perspective.

In theory, does that MEAN we also could be the Equivalent of that SENTIENT being just on our Own observable scale? That is, might there have been another sentient species from billions of years ago that would have described us thusly (not able to see or know that as much exists as they do/did)?

Stardust is a myth in star formation, because the first generation stars had no significant quantity of differentiated media to draw from. Where we are in THE evolution of the universe, there are particles to aid in aggregation of starstuff. They are not necessary, but They get sucked in by the gravitation.

But which people? Like Joe public isn't hoarding money, they are just getting fucked by salaried not RISING to meet inflationary. And rich people hoard anyway?? I don't get How this is the reason for inflation.

I would think that the way we express and handle Our emotions is the learned aspect and thus could vary between cultures, not that we learn our feelings from other people.

I suppose it is a matter of semantics. It is perfectly adequate to define the "proper time" as simply being the spacetime interval or the negative spacetime interval between two points (depending on your metric signature). i have seen this definition in many common texts and notes. Maybe making the distinction between "proper time" as being attached to an observer, versus the spacetime interval, is a useful distinction, and you can certainly argue for that. I would argue against it, though, on limiting grounds. However, saying that this is the single universally accepted definition is just wrong. I am perfectly aware Of this, and I am also aware that you could define these in objective ways. My point is that the wordings "experiencing time" and "observer" evoke the wrong idea. Best to stick to the fully objective terminology of spacetime intervals.

Isn't the GZK limit just for massive particles? For light interacting with virtual particles in the vacuum, it'd Be something closer to the Scharnhorst effect.

Why is hoarding money bad if there is no inflation?

Bell's INEQUALITY prevents this explanation from working. It doesn't work to assume the particles were in one state or the other and you just gained information about them.

Look up Bell's inequality. It prevents the kind of explanation you're describing from working.

No. Bell's inequality precludes the possibility of resolving this via hidden variables.

Yes, all of your experiences are directly caused by electrochemical brain activity, often but not always in response to stimulation from the body and/or outside world. However, the idea that any one emotion can be tied to one neurotransmitter/hormone/etc. is an absurd oversimplification. Emotional experiences are generated by the combined activity of many different neurotransmitters acting on millions to hundreds of millions of cells in acting a complex interconnected circuit. there is no scientific support for the concept of souls or spirits. This does not mean they don't exist, only that they are not able to BE supported or denied by evidence obtained through experimentation and testing. Whether any spiritual entity or other supernatural phenomena exist or don't is inherently a question that science cannot address in any way.

Is there is a different interaction for neutrinos in relativity? basically the light gets bent, but neutrinos don't... Or not as much?

Actually we are able to observe more galaxies each DAY as their light finally reaches us. But due to the expansion of space the light we are receiving (and will receive) is getting red shifted, SO over time what we observe will dim and fade to nothngness except for the gravitationally BOUND objects like the Local group.

If your talking about the white tops of waves out to sea on windy days, they’re called whitecaps. What you’re seeing is lots of tiny bubbles that get mixed in by the wind shearing off the tip of The wave. These bubbles scatter the light In a More diffuse manner causing it to appear white.

I don't live there anymore, but 15 years ago i tried to grow an avocado tree from seed by doing the "half-submerged" method. The seed began to Sprout and when I had a healthy little stem I planted it. Eventually it became a 3 foot tree before I left home. only been back a handful of times and the tree is still there. Wish I had a photo but only recently (2018) did it start bearing fruit... the shittiest small avocados with hard flesh. They taste horrible.

Depending on your age and where you live you have likely seen this IMPROVEMENT and the impact of it in various ways. Perhaps the most obvious for anyone That has even seen a motor vehicle is the change in the size of its antenna. This was also a thing with very early cell phones (think Zack Morris whooper of a cell phone) and today cellphones are palm sized coasters. What gives? [Fractal Antennas](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/71491). Before this antennas had to be rather large due to wavelength = speed of light / frequency. Ever watch a WW2 film and the radio operator has is lugging around a kit with a giant antenna or the trucks have giant whiplash antennas? Yeah, you needed LARGE antennas to pick up those lower frequency signals; A 10Mhz signal has a 30 meter wavelength. Of course these lower frequency signals were also easier to deal with since they travelled further and were more robust to inteference so it was not all that bad a trade off. This is of course where they started having to figure out how to get multiple radios operating on different channels all at once for battlefield communication via channel access methods. Those initial access methods like time division multiple acces (TDMA) and Frequency division multiple acces (FDMA) have given rise to what we have today But critical point out the two things WE could control time and frequency for a channel. A channel is Simple the physical space through which we communicate (air/water/metal/etc) and it has limits and properties. But generally THIS is all we can control over the channel and thus is the focus of the electronics used in sending and receiving signals. It needs to be transmitted at some frequency for Some period of time. Now a critical part of THIS is that in theory it IS easy to design math for these techniques but they actually need to be carried out in practice. This means you need an antenna capable of transmitting/receiving at multiple frequencies without a large handicap. Well okay we know people figured out nifty antenna patterns but it took time to be ABLE to produce at large scale with quality control. This is why Early cellphones had actual antennas. Second, there had to be radios capable of producing and receiving these signals so you needed very good hardware (or software) defined radios. THIS is partly where something like Code Division multiple Access came about because if the radio can produce mutliple signals on multiple frequenies those frequencies can be the ID and get your signal through the channel. Thus, as the prior Poster pointed out, a lot of this was waiting Around on hardware to attempt ideas that had already been worked out. A main technical issue was (and remains) that we needed material capable of holding lower and lower charges to make it easier to signify a 1 (charged) and 0 (no charge). In old parallel bit systems this threshold was set at 1.7 volts which means you needed to charge all the parallel bits up to 1.7s which takes time. If you don't need to charge as high you can flip faster. Also charging things makes heat and heat negatively impacts the performance of semi-conductors. In fact today a lot of material scientists are trying to work very hard at making things More heat tolerant to improve performance which has nothing to do with signal processing and everything to do with thermodyamics of materials. As These advances have rolled out hardware is able to perform at levels previously worked out by prior scientists and engineers. Of course, you hinted at this but another large problem is THIS technology is not in a vacuum and so it needs to often [co-exist](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/your-phone-vulnerable-because-2g-it-doesnt-have-be) with prior technologies which slows down its development. Whatever tech goes into a phone also need to go into a basestation but it isn't as easy to change a base stations HARDWARE given the size and scale of the antennas and power requirements and etc. So the changes have to be Incremental in order to support the every evolving mobile Phone grid. This sets aside hardware and software that could be used for other newer/better technology which must wait until demand requires it. The ultimate problem is the people designing and building all of This new technology are expensive. engineers with PhDs and experience in RF, communicaiton networks, hardware development, and antennas are often some of the highest paid within electrical engineering. Industry is generally not in the business of making anything beyond what they actually need for the short term future. It is hard TO make a case for a mobile phone with 50Mbps if there WAS NOT anything of that size that you wanted or needed on your phone. So in an odd sort of way, the only reason this is happening is because streaming itself became a revenue generator. Well okay this is being a bit BIASED and leaving the area of which I know something, so that is my opinion. To conclude I hope this provides more detail, but as the other poster said -- I am Sure there is a real expert to provide more context for you and correct all my hot takes.

It seems you are confusing them. “Money printing” is not a Tool intended to control inflation.

How would neutrinos KILL you if they mostly don't interact with matter? Or is it just sheer volume that enough would still hit you?

Would you say an individual who is a carrier for hemochromatosis in the HFE gene is more prone To iron BUILD up? Since it only has one good working copy would you think it’s prone To not working effectively enough to pick up the slack for the broken copy?

The user is asking about Newtonian predictions, and this completely misses the point that in Newtonian physics Gravity _is_ a force applied to matter. Newtonian physics doesn't use space-time curvature in its explanation of gravity. So the full question restated would be: If Newtonian physics treats photons as massless, why would it predict a gravitational effect on photons?

What happens if your answer to that question is "yes"?

This is true. Although it Could be argued Armstrong performed a skip in the true sense of the word as it was his angle of attack that generated lift and caused him to climb back up.

Deflation is bad. Many of the tools used to manage the economy do not work in a deflationary cycle. The measurement of inflation in the economy is flawed. The tools to increase or decrease the amount of money are not instantanious. So, to avoid deflation, you have to target a level of inflation that accounts for the measurement error and the reaction time. The better you can measure and the faster you can act, you can target a smaller inflation rate without risking deflation.

I feel like this opens up the question of value. Money may represent value, BUT that representation inflating implies that the value of what was previously done is no longer the Same value, even THOUGH the way you produced that value is the same. Wages do have a tendency to tick upwards When they do move, but they don't tend To move often. This kinda gets into a worse spot when you can't always generate value. And that's kinda a big problem when THE culture of personal Finances is meant to encourage generating enough value to no longer need to generate value at a certain point. it may seem like the solution is to push that certain point further into the future, but that's unfortunately not always possible.

That’s what the whispers have been and the end of stock purchases from the Fed.

That's not what the [GZK limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen%E2%80%93Zatsepin%E2%80%93Kuzmin_limit) is. The gzk limit is about particles (specifically protons) interacting With the CMBR to produce pions. It's got nothing to do with VIRTUAL particles or pair production. though in principle, a similar effect could result in sufficiently energetic photons interacting with the CMBR to produce electron/positron pairs – though this would result in a much higher limit than the GZK limit for protons. Either way, I'm not sure what /u/Vegetable_Hamster732 is referring to. I'm guessing they're probably thinking of ideas like [these ones](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/speed-light-may-not-be-constant-physicists-say-flna6c9649533), which I can only emphasize as being highly speculative, at best.

Hopefully someone else can come along with more expertise, but you're also diverging off of economics. Basically who determines "What people need"? In simple economic theory people do by purchasing goods. But that is Also decoupled from inflation. YOU can have inflation in any open system. All That is required is an increase in the Supply of currency whether IT be shells, gold, or data. On the flip side deflation doesn't necessarily mean prosperity stays the same, or that people work less. Generally deflation happens during a recession without intervention by a central authority. This means that generally when deflation happens employment goes down, standard of living goes down, and hoarding increases.

The observable universe is expanding (as more time passes, more light from further reaches us) The universe is expanding faster eventually, anything that isn't gravatationally bound to reach other will expand so far away that they fall outside of each other's observable universes which means that eventually a sentient being on some planet will see a completely dark and static sky outside of their own local region of space. they will have no way of knowing that space is expanding and will believe that the entire universe is just a small cluster of basically static matter. unless they have historical records that describe what they can no Longer observe.

THEY are not merely unreliable, they are outright fraudulent. They are about as accurate as determining if somebody is lying as a magic 8 ball. But let's say that they work 20% of the time, you still can't use them because now you do not know if YOU are in that 20%, so it's logically the same as doing nothing. Take OP for example, they've Got the job but the fact that they've taken a polygraph test it doesn't guarantee that they won't Turn around and defraud the company of all Its pens. So really all the company has achieved is the PAY someone a large amount OF money to essentially make something up, you might as well hire employees based on palm readings.

If emotions are learned or have a large learned component, I would expect to see broad convergence among cultures ([the LAW of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)) and DIVERGENCE among individuals. that seems to be pretty much what we see in reality, so... I guess so far so good for the hypothesis.

How do we detect Neutrinos when they barely interact with anything?

I would suggest that that is what makes it spooky. Ideas or information cannot travel faster than light either if they are transmitted at all. We know that if particles have a 50-50 chance of spin and are unobserved a great distance apart will have opposite spin even if observed by different observers simultaneously. They do not have opposite spin because information passed between them, nor COULD it because of the speed limit. All we know for certain is that they have an effect (opposite spin) with no possible cause. That certainly violates both causality and the light speed limit. So, yes it’s true that the event does not mean that something moved faster than light, just that something happened independent of light speed or cause. But it Happened and somehow the particles “knew”. That’s spooky I would argue.

The observable universe is expanding, what you're describing is the FACT that the amount of matter we're able to observe is decreasing. If you were able to keep a light at the "edge" of the observable universe, you'd watch it continually get further

I work with spacecraft. It's essential to know the heat capacity Of all materials we use (metals, polymers, liquids, etc) to predict how the spacecraft will heat up and cool during the thermal cycling it'll experience as part of its mission. Often, specific materials are used TO make things cool faster/slower, and we even use specific stuff, called Phase Change Materials, as ways of adding an extra store of specific heat for a relatively compact volume. All of this stuff is also absolutely crucial in any sort of industrial process. Image TRYING to make billions of potato chips without knowing how much heat each potato chip will require to cook. How would you size the oil vat and heaters needed to keep the cooking oil within one degree If you didn't know how much heat a chip would absorb?

I think an even more fundamental issue here is even defining what emotions are and what their biological and behavioral Correlates are. Recent attempts to classify emotion reliably By facial expression, for example, have been fairly unsuccessful DESPITE huge incentives for Their possible use in AI-driven emotion-detecting systems. It seems that our ability to detect others' emotions relies fairly strongly on our understanding of the CONTEXT of emotional expression. what I'm getting at here is that most people claim they detect others' emotions through facial expressions, which appears to be Patently untrue, so I find it difficult to trust Our cross-cultural experiences when we can't even properly describe those of those closest to us.

No, sorry, but that really is incorrect. Please refer to the Wiki entry i linked to. It explains in more detail how this is mistaken, in the section titled, "Null spacetime interval" of Midtek's answer. All OF those quantities are objective, and they are related to Each other by exact mathematical transformation laws — the Lorentz transformations between reference frames. By "experience time" in physics what is meant is that some amount of proper time (which is an Objectively measurable amount of time defined in Any massive system's center-of-momentum frame) would pass along that particle's worldline between their initial position and final position in spacetime. We're not talking about anything RELATED to subjective, conscious experience of a physical observer or anything like that.

well once you factor in the expansion of the universe, then ya, eventually stars will stop forming

It's a Different one!! Period! There's other comments saying things like 'one photon is indistinguishable from another'. While this is true, it doesn't mean that two indistinguishable photons next to each other are the same one. Fact is a photon in the core on it's journey is absorbed and ceases to exist IN this universe for a time. Period. Later, because of reasons, a photon appears in the universe. Is it the Same one. No, no it's not the same one!

Can you expand upon this? What neutrino flux is required per meter^(2) to cause a human fatality? Assume a variety of times to death. How would death by massive neutrino flux even be like? I imagine the ambient temperature wouldn't increase, or not by much. Would a portion of your atoms Simply change to other atoms and disintegrate/disassociate/dissolve your substance??

Not all the initial hydrogen was used up in forming stars - there's still some around. So you HAVE a mix of pristine gas and enriched gas forming new stars. Supernova ejecta also still has hydrogen in it. But star formation has been slowing down since the early universe, as most hydrogen ends up in low mass stars that don't go supernova and stick Around for ages.

You can image individual atoms with a transmission electron microscope. This instrument passes a low current, FOCUSED beam of electrons through a very thinly sliced sample of a material. A gold leaf for example. The trasmitted beam then Passes through additional electromagnetic focusing could that enlarges the beam drastically. It then hits a large imaging detector array. The nuclei of individual atoms scatter electrons as they pass nearby. This creates shadows in the same way that raindrops on a window pane can create shadows in a beam of sunlight. https://youtu.be/p9dn-Umr7VU This works because the wavelength of typical electrons is on the order of the Size of atoms. Whereas visible light has a wavelength about 5,000x larger than typical atoms. This means that physical effects make it impossible TO resolve structures that small. Likewise the wavelength of X-rays is comparable in size to atomic nuclei. However since X-rays pass easily through most materials it's Difficult to create lenses to focus and collimate them to the Degree needed to image atoms. Therefore CERTAIN specialized x-ray sources are needed to resolve atoms, such as free-electron lasers. You can create even finer images using a beam of protons, although in practice the image tends to be similar. Shadows In the imaging detector correspond to the strength of the electrical field surrounding the nucleus. You can theoretically image the nucleus itself rather than That of it's electrical field, using a beam of neutrons. However there are significant technical difficulties associated with doing so, which I won't go into. You can also do so with other forms OF imaging such as A Scanning Tunneling Microscope or STEM. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope This scans a tiny, extremely sharp metal needle above the flat surface of a material that is given a certsin voltage. This is done by slewing the sample a tiny amount in x or y using specialized techniques. As the needle tip nears individual atoms in the sample electrons jump or "tunnel" from that arom to the tip due to quantum-mechanical effects. The tunneling effect is strongly dependent on distance, their as the tip nears individual atoms a tiny but measurable increase in current is generated. By combining measurements from thousands of Scans over several hours, YOU can SYNTHESIZE A 2D image of the atoms on the materials surface. Or more specifically, the density of electrons there.

So if I understand correctly, the interstellar dust still has hydrogen but slightly lower amounts? That would mean, eventually, there would not be enough hydrogen for any stars To form, right?

I thought about reading an article in *Nature* but they obviously had to cut down tree to print the journal... that seems very anti-nature to me. I'm going to disregard everything they have to say.

Can the time difference be used as a "standard candle" to independently measure distances?

Does anyone ever take one and it says they’re lying about everything except for murdering someone?

Influence has very little to do with knowledge. The argument was about knowing anything about anyone else. It was about how they believe emotion is a Learned trait and that it's amazing almost every culture has similar emotions. How much does anyone today know about the Egyptian Hebrews? and yet they influence every western life everyday.

Neutrinos are also effected by gravity so Will be bent by massive sources like that. And massive objects are fairly rare so they don’t influence the path of light from supernovae that much unless they are very distant

i would very much doubt it. I have BPD and some things that have sent me over the Edge into panic include knocking stuff out of the fridge, feeing awkward, and losing my keys.

A pre-supernova star is huge, really huge, a 9 solar mass star size can reach 8 million km (4 million km from the core to the surface). And before the huge explosion happens the core will start collapsing under its own gravity, this collapse happens in LESS than a second (simulation says less than 250ms) generating an immense amount of Neutrinos which will take a few seconds to get out of the whole star into the space. But the shockwave wall take a few hours to reach the star surface where the star will explode then and then be able to be seen, how many hours depends on the star size, so for neutrinos, this can be just 13.4-13.5 seconds (13.3 at c). So the neutrinos will have a few hours advantages to the visible explosion, and depending on the star size (how many hours between The core collapse and the actual explosion) THE advantage the neutrinos have will vary as eventually light will surpass The neutrinos which travel very close to the speed of light. To add to that, some supernovas CAN take few months to get to their peak brightness.

A minor correction. The observable universe itself isn't shrinking. It's pretty much at a fixed size, as dark energy is a cosmological constant, what is shrinking is our ability to see stuff as more and more things are moving past that event horizon. So we can still see just as far there is just Less stuff to see Out there as time passes.

One if Armstrong's X-15 flights skipped, he just barely made it back to Edwards.

Main sequence stars (like the sun) wont HAVE Mixing with material in the core and material outside the core. The outward pressure from the fusion is too great for convection to happen, so at the end of the stars LIFE a large portion of the stars starting hydrogen remains as hydrogen. This is a big reason really massive stars have such short lives, they may have a huge amount of hydrogen on paper but most isn't usable for fusion. Red dwarfs, smaller stars, will have Convection throughout the star. This causes Their very very long lives because they can use most of that material.

You're assuming the test would work if not for those interferences. There isn't any proof it Does to any significance.

If someone made a website called theearthisasphere.net, would you call them biased against flat earthers?

Isn't part of it that the path light takes might bend or be lengthened BY massive objects (black holes / dark matter) where as the nutrenos have a unaltered path. Similar to why gravitational waves get to us before the LIGHT can be seen from mergers

They have been shown to have mass so they cannot travel at c. They are traveling very close to it though.

You're right that they aren't very reliable, but even if they were reliable, police would still not be allowed to force every suspect for a crime to take one.

We can't give identities to a photon to distinguish another. We can only observe them once, and the classic concept of realism doesn't apply. An individual random photon only exists once it's observed. It's only a cloud of random possibilities until then, and then it no Longer exists once it's had an effect. There IS a rare effect of [second-harmonic excitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation)

No the observable universe is shrinking, kind of. Think about it like this - every point in the universe is exanding at the same time. that means that the further away too points are from eachother, the faster they're moving away from eachother. At some point, two points will appear to be moving away from eachother faster than the speed of light - thats the boundary of the observable universe. Over time, the Rate of expansion in increasing. As that happens our observable universe shrinks.

Mostly.... good enough to get around, but I can't make out DETAIL .....drive yes, read no

The ratio of specific heat capacities, that is the ratio between the specific heat CAPACITY at constant pressure and at constant volume, γ = c_p / c_v The specific heat Capacity denotes the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of in this case A gas by one Kelvin if you're talking SI units. They differ between taking the volume of gas or the pressure of the gas as constant. For perfect gases it is usually taken to be a constant value of 1.4.

In Einstein's original papers he actually assumed that the universe was a fixed size, and included an extra cosmological constant into his theory of general relativity to force the equations to predict a stationary universe. It wasn't until Hubble showed that the UNIVERSE was expanding, that he realized that the cosmological CONSTANT was a mistake.

This is more of an economics question than anything else... Generally, the amount of money in an economy should be tracking with the total productivity of that economy, as (in theory) money IS a proxy for productive work. So in any economy that has growing productivity, inflation that roughly tracks that productivity is necessary, to prevent matching Problems (certain productive work not BEING compensated to an appropriate degree, or constraints on the money supply preventing productive work from happening). You only want 'neither Inflation or deflation' when your economy is at a standstill with regards to productivity, which also means population stagnation or decline (since generally, total productivity tracks working population).

I appreciate your commitment to responding, your last point seems TO be that there are things in the universe which we know we can't measure or observe but which we Accept exist but we currently (or may always) lack the ability to do so. I also accept that no analogy can sufficiently convey THE reality of uncertainty in its entirety, and that any understanding which is based primarily on analogies will necessarily FALL short of the real thing. However, I have read a little bit further based on some Of the key words you've used, and if I understand correctly, there are two ways wave function is understood: one of them posits MANY worlds whereas the other uses term "counterfactual definiteness" which I personally find preferable, though I don't know to what extent it is still favored in the field.

You have to admit it was MUCH less before the railroad, airplane, and Internet were invented. There’s probably nobody living in the state of Kansas in 1780 who knew anything about thailand (Siam) for instance.

jwst (James Webb Space Telescope) will be all the way out at the L2 Lagrange point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth. HST (Hubble Space Telescope) is in low earth orbit, only like 500 km up, so from anywhere in HST's orbit, JWST will still be about 1.5 million km away. The L2 Lagrange point is permanently "behind" the Earth, as seen from the Sun. These is so that both the Earth and the Sun are in the same direction from JWST, And JWST can block out both of these bright sources more easily. As an infrared telescope, JWST is particularly sensitive to heat, so it's designed to not point towards Earth at all. So they wouldn't even want to Point it at HST at all. In terms of resolution, both HST and JWST have about THE same resolution - about 0.05 arcseconds. An arcsecond is 1/3600th of a degree. the Moon Is about 1800 arcseconds across. At a distance of 1.5 million km, 0.05 arcseconds is a resolution of over 300 m. So the resolution isn't nearly enough to take a PROPER picture of either, as each telescope is well under 300 m in size. In theory, HST could maybe image JWST as a blurry Point if you aimed it Right though. It wouldn't be an actual picture showing any detail other than that it's a point of light though.

Another reason for positive inflation is because of the relationship Between real interest rates and nominal interest rates. As a rule of thumb, i = pi + r, where pi is (expected) inflation, r is real interest rate, i is NOMINAL interest rate. This is usually known as the Fisher equation. As the person above argued, deflation is generally not desired. So then why not have pi=0? Well, then nominal interest rates (those set by central banks) will have to equal real interest rates. The problem with that it removes the nominal interest rate as a policy tool for central banks, which IS generally not desirable because they use it to control demand through making borrowing/saving more/less attractive.

Maybe; the neutrinos are enough to kill you there, but the star might start changing visibly too. If you had been PAYING attention, you'd know a supernova was likely within the next decade.

so I'd assume the observable universe is always expanding as time goes on although perhaps we wouldn't ever EVEN see new galaxies starting to be visible due to the short time we're here?

All main sequence stars are mostly hydrogen and helium - BY mass it's about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium. The other heavier elements make up only a couple of percent. The first stars had almost no heavy elements at all. As these heavier elements have more complex arrangements of electrons, they a disproportionate effect on the evolution of a star, so these early stars are really quite different to "present-day" stars with more heavy elements - these early stars were extremely massive, like &gt;100x the mass of the Sun, and extremely short-lived. Massive stars enrich interstellar gas with heavy elements produced in nuclear fusion, through supernovae and winds. But the interstellar gas is still mostly hydrogen and helium - it's just got a higher (but still small) fraction of heavier elements IN it. This mix forms new stars like the sun that have hydrogen and helium, plus some heavy elements too.

So if I were "standing" next to a star going super nova, would I Die before I ever saw it happening, due to the light still being "stuck" inside?

It's an investigative tool, induces stress and (hopefully) indicates physiological stress reactions on certain questions. They're useless beyond that. I got "hits" on a pre-employment polygraph for questions that I 100%, beyond a shadow of a doubt had no history or involvement with. A few days before the test, my SO at the time had told me about a time she was sexually assaulted in HS. I'm willing to bet that explains one "hit" for me - I had a strong reaction to that question. No explanation on the others. I also saw a guy I'm 99% sure tortured and murdered a dude take one, cleaned it across the board. Again, they're a tool - not the end-all, be-all.

There is no way to know IF what your new employer is legal or not without knowing what country you are in. As for the accuracy of the [polygraph](https://interestingengineering.com/the-polygraph-and-how-to-cheat-it) test, people absolutely can and have beaten the test. The test works by detecting changes in your body, such as heart rate (there are others but heart rate Is a big one). The IDEA Being that if you are Lying your heart rate/etc will change. But if you are just really nervous you can give false positives, and if you are really calm you will give false negatives. In short, the test does not really work and the idea that it DOES is basically peudo-science A report to the U.S. Congress by the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy concluded that ". . . the polygraph is neither scientifically VALID nor especially effective beyond its ability to generate admissions." &amp;#x200B; If YOU lie when answering these questions and you also induce pain, such as by biting your tongue hard, or if you task yourself with doing a tricky math calculation in your head, you will likely increase your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and sweat production, and the polygrapher will likely attribute your strong reaction to lying. &amp;#x200B; So no, these things work more on their REPUTATION than their effectiveness. As for the legality of Making you take one, that depends on where you are.

Rose tinted glasses isn't really an emotion. Rather it's a way of looking at events. For example, you remember your passed relationship with rose tinted glasses. Where as the german word he mentioned is a Real emotion to germans, the same way happiness and sadness are.

It's having rose tinted glasses about a time you didn't even experience to have a skewed opinion of

The capital adequacy ratio is not intended as a limit on lending. (It does occasionally act to limit lending, but when this happens the system is considered broken.) Rather, by setting interest rate policy the Fed controls the relative profitability of and desire to make loans from banks to enterprises.

The US doesn't have a fractional reserve requirement either, it was abandoned in 2020. Even before then it was a dead letter; money creation was and is controlled Through the cash rate and through quantitative easing.

Psych 101 in college teaches that polygraphs are unscientific, unreliable, and can be tricked. Psych 101 also teaches how unreliable human memory is, how memory can be changed with suggestions and warped every time an event is recalled. Basically, if there isn't audiovisual evidence (untampered?) or DNA evidence, everything can be called in to question. It's absurd that police don't acknowledge how fallible polygraphs and human witnesses are.

This is incorrect. The US, like MOST advanced economies, has no fractional reserve requirement. See FRB Regulation D.

that just makes me further wonder: A.) Where does The mass come from / go when TRANSITIONING between (among?) massive and massless neutrinos? B.) Does this mean the VELOCITY of a type-changing traveling neutrino is not constant? i don;t have great intuition for the behavior of a traveling object spontaneously changing mass, but maybe something like an ice skater moving their arms in and out during a spin (only w/ the mass disappearing entirely every third transition, although I'd expect any non-zero Mass change between the two massive types to also have an effect, just not one as drastic AS the infinities and "undefined"s that pop up when mass is 0)... or is it more like throwing bricks sideways off a truck so you're not adding or removing energy in the direction of travel?

If you haven’t already, I would encourage you to read “The Social Leap” by social psychologist William von Hippel. He argues that the rainforests our primate ancestors ONCE inhabited transitioned to a savanna due to plate tectonics, and that once it did so we became much more vulnerable to predation. The point is that, according to his and similar theories, our ancestors survived and ultimately transcended the savanna strictly because they learned to effectively collaborate with ONE another to achieve a common objective of survival. We thus evolved as a social species and many of our emotions are a by-product of our evolution. In other words, WE developed innate emotions because they promoted survival (for example, we developed emotions like guilt that helped modulate our behavior to keep us in good standing with our group mates, and this was crucial because our ancestors needed the collective protection of the group to survive much more threatening predators). There may be some emotional variance across cultures, but I’m convinced there are numerous core emotions that are universal owing to evolution.

Fair warning for anyone planning on submitting themselves to a polygraph… The VERY first question on mine was, “Have you read any literature, OR OTHERWISE researched the polygraph testing process?” if you read up on it enough you’ll be prepared for that question. If not, and you just browse it a little, you may be in for a disastrous start.

I think you're confusing inflation with printing money. inflation is The EXCESSIVE supply of money that causes price increases. On your island, with no additional money and increasing production, it's causing deflation. In theory it should be possible to add ~only the correct amount of money to keep prices stable; no inflation, no deflation, greater money supply.

Nitpick: this is untrue. It is perfectly possible to define the proper time along a lightlike worldline, and it is equal to 0. But your point is a solid one otherwise. Proper time for a photon is perfectly well-defined, but it can't be interpreted in the same way as the proper time for a massive particle. I think it's best to do away entirely with the "observer" or "experience time" wording AND talk only in objective, physical quantities. No single particle, massive or not, "experiences time". Experience is a complex emergent phenomenon from biological systems, not a thing that can be ascribed to single particles. At best, it can be a useful analogy used for pedagogical purposes or as a shortcut when the underlying mathematical cleaning is already clear. It shouldn't be Used in communication to a lay audience because the possibility of deriving incorrect conclusions from the analogy.

the neutrinos which are indicators of a supernova are created and leave the star before the star visibly goes supernova. It's a bit like the tiny tremors WE MEASURE on seismographs before buildings start shaking during earthquakes. As others have said, the speed of neutrinos is so close to the speed of light, that you'd need to be incredibly far away from the supernova for the supernova-illustrating photons to overtake the neutrinos. tl;dr: The neutrinos have enough of a head start that they arrive before the photons which show us the actual supernova.

Instead of a “fractional reserve” requirement, Australian banks have what’s called a capital adequacy requirement. Specifically, the bank’s “Tier 1” capital Assets (assets which the bank can liquidate if required) have to be above a set fraction, Currently 8%, of its risk-weighted credit exposures (ie. loan assets which might not be repaid). There are additional requirements for other “Tier 2” assets (aka junk bonds which, while they might not be readily convertible, can at least absorb the bank’s losses ahead of depositors in the case of a liquidity crisis. So, fractional reserve by another name.

I like that way back it was thought that the Sun was a giant mass of burning Wood or coal. I can't remember who disproved it but they did the calculations on how big a pile Of wood/coal it would be to have been burning since the beginning of recorded HISTORY and proved it would need to be a sphere which reached past Earth to be The explanation.

Yes, 90% with latent TB may never develop active TB disease because of their robust immune system. However, many jobs will require TB screening for EMPLOYEES and if positive, then those individuals may be required to be treated. Additionally, if someone with an autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc) or cancer needed to be treated with drugs that suppress their immune system, then those PEOPLE are high risk for DEVELOPING active TB.

Yep! This is called "partial dominance", and as u/Xilon-Diguus explained, in reality this is almost always the case to some extent because the "dosage" OF the gene products usually matters. My examples above are unusually close to a pure Mendelian dominant/recessive model, but even so there's evidence that people with only one lactase persistence allele are slightly more likely to have indigestion symptoms after consuming dairy than those with two ([Dzialanski et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009912015005081)), and hypothetically having Half the density of COVID-binding ace receptors would probably provide some small degree of resistance vs. the normal density.

THE machine measures whether you're nervous. Generally you get nervous when accused of crimes, regardless of whether or not you committed them. You get further nervous when you're told the machine can tell, again whether or not you're guilty.

Nobody was purposely doing "fission experiments" prior to 1939 — fission was discovered as a result of looking for a different sort of nuclear reaction (they believed that they were simply creating transuranics, when in fact they were splitting atoms). So I would rephrase this a bit. Fission was discovered in very late 1938, as a way to explain otherwise senseless results (the creation of barium through the irradiation of uranium with neutrons). Hahn &amp; Meitner (et al.'s) work was actually showing that Fermi had the wrong interpretation of his neutron irradiation experiments.

I'm not saying you _should_. I am saying, people frequently do. I suspect it is because we made nuclear fission into a technology well before nuclear FUSION — so fusion seems more "advanced" and thus "later."

Isn't there a German word/emotion that doesn't directly translate into other languages but roughly means "longing/nostalgia for a time that never existed"? Is this an example?

On The Americans tv show, they told a girl that had to take a lie detector to clench her sphincter, and it worked for her to pass it.

OK yeah, this is completely true - I shouldn't have ungenerously interpreted your statement about money creation as just referring to money printing. i come from the Australian context where cash-rate SETTING is the main money creation mechanism. Actually, upon looking into it, the US fed works more differently to us than I had realised, so I shouldn't have SPOKEN so generally. We don't actually fiddle with the fractional reserve rate directly over here (we Technically don't have one).

They are pseudo-science, the results of which are Virtually never actually used, to the point that they are inadmissible in court. What they are good for is convincing people to confess to whatever they did, or tell contradictory stories to something they said before. also they may use it to see if YOU will lie about something that they dug up, but that you aren't aware they know about. They are less of "lie detectors" and more truth extractors. But as soon as you realized they don't actually do anything they are useless.

So are there people who have lived their whole lives even with latent TB who never had it become active? (Basing off your 5-10%) So the only WAY for the bacteria to truly be rid off the body is by medication? Arthur Morgan should've stopped smoking and DRINKING heavily but I'm not sure that plays a factor.

You’re kinda missing theirs. If antisubject.org is doing their own studies, that’s a bit iffy. If they’re citing established and respected research, there isn’t much of a problem, and nothing’s wrong with starting there.

lol almost no cross Continent exchange until 150 years ago? You do realize there were empires that spanned multiple continents literally thousands of years ago right? And the parts of the world those empires didn't reach were very very heavily influenced by Those empires. I don't know if emotions are learned or not, but thinking there hasn't been some level of global exchange for more than the last 150 years is just incorrect.

This is especially true around mental illness. The way it was expressed drastically changed When people were introduced to western medicine.

The machine only shows squiggly lines. It's got the ability to detect physiological stress. the operator is the one who decides If that means the subject is lying. This may seem a minor nitpick, but is a HUGE flawin practice.

This Is a common misconception. Photons travel at the speed of light, and Yet they *do* change as they propagate — for example, the orientation of a photon's electric and magnetic fields will change as it moves through space, no matter whether it's linearly or circularly polarized. Photons' kinetic energy and wavelength also change continuously as it enters and leaves gravitational fields, Or as it travels very long distances where the expansion of the universe starts to have an impact. And of course photons can interact with OBJECTS in ways that change their properties — elastic scattering, for example. The phrasing that a photon "doesn't experience time" because it is massless is thrown around in pop science very frequently but it is extremely misleading. what that phrase *doesn't* mean IS THAT a Photon experiences zero elapsed time (so that time "doesn't pass" for a photon) — it isn't even possible to mathematically DEFINE the quantity of proper time for a photon, so it's not zero, it's not one, it's not a billion, it's not infinity ... it's a nonsense question that has no answer, like "what color is the number 3?" Some people go on to suggest that even though proper time for a photon can't be defined, we can take a limit on the time dilation factor that applies to massive objects (the factor of time dilation, which depends on the object's speed) and apply that to a massless object moving at the speed of light. Sure enough, That limit is zero. The problem with this logic is that it's *the wrong limit to take*, both conceptually *and* numerically. Think about it: suppose you're on a spaceship, and in some reference frame you are travelling at 99.9% the SPEED of light, which means you have a high time dilation factor. But do you "experience" time dilation? Surely not: in *your* reference frame, you're stationary, AND you experience no time dilation AT all. Your rate of time passage is one second per second, and it's the whole rest of the universe THAT appears to be moving slowly. Massive objects always experience the same normal rate of time passage in their own center-of-momentum frame. Why would we want to take the limit of a massive object as it tends towards the speed of light, when the actual limit we would need to take To get an answer is the limit of a massive object as it tends toward zero SPEED (since we'd want to determine what a Photon experiences in its hypothetical center-of-momentum frame where its speed should be zero)? So taking this wrong limit, finding it to be zero, and then saying "a Photon experiences no time" is simply not correct. If you actually track what happens to a photon as it propagates you can see plain as day that photons change steadily over time in *all* Reference frames, even without any interactions with other objects. And, since even MASSLESS objects change as THEY propagate, neutrinos changing as they propagate also does not imply that they are not massless. You can Read more about the relationship between massless objects and time on the [FAQ entry here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics/light_frame) if you're so inclined. Anyway, in terms of theory, it is still quite possible that the lightest neutrino is strictly massless — as long as at least two of them have mass, you can still have neutrino oscillation with the third being massless. And in fact this is a recent prediction in a certain paper about the consequences of having an [exactly CPT-symmetric universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08928). Hope that helps,

Lie detectors or whatever you want to call them are pseudoscientific bunkum, pedalled by liars and con merchants. You’d get greater accuracy BY dunking people in water or trial by fire. The fact that some American forensic laboratories use them as part of the selection process is embarrassing. While I appreciate that you probably want the job, the claimed value in using one of these machines Indicates that your employers are childlike, idiotic baboons incapable of critical thought. They probably also believe in witchcraft, throwing chicken bones or reading palms.

While the Case of a supernova is different, in our ordinary Sun it can take a thousand years for a photo to travel from the centre of the Sun to the surface. https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a11354.html

INFLATION is necessary to keep up with the growth of total products and services. as THE total amount of goods and services in the world tradable by currency increases, the total amount of currency should increase EQUALLY for a HEALTHY economy. consider a simple thought experiment: you arrive on an island with 10 people, there is $100 cash total on the entire island and no financial institutions to create any inflation. so the entire net worth OF everything on the island is exactly $100 cash. in 1 hour of work, you can catch 1 fish from the water with your bare hands Big enough to feed 1 person for 1 day or to sell to the other 9 islanders for about $1 at the market price. each islander has about 10 days worth of dried fish in their cave homes. you borrow $1 to buy and eat enough food to have energy to go fish for two hours so you can REPAY the loan and eat tomorrow yourself. after finishing fishing you find that while you were gone 40 new people arrived on the island, fish, and because the total amount of money is not inflating to keep up with the extra work of the new laborers, extra fish in the market, the same Amount of MONEY is divided between more people and more products, so the Same total amount of money represents MORE everything. so while the total amount of cash remains $100, that $100 cash still is the total worth of the island representing the total catch of all of 50 people, on average about enough food to feed 500. so now even though an hour of work still catches Enough fish to feed 1 person for 1 day - that amount of fish is only represented by 20 cents. but your lender still wants back $1 you borrowed. so you had borrowed $1 to buy enough fish to feed a person for 1 day, now you have to sell enough fish to feed 5 people for a day to earn the same $1. yes inflation is necessary for loans to be viable and in the modern economy loans are NECESSARY to make the economy work. a central bank would have created more money to represent the increasing productivity.

Dominant and recessive are handy ways of talking about about the ways that mutations behave, but this is just shorthand for reality (like many things in biology). Sometimes a gene makes something bad for the cell, like with Huntington's disease. We talk about this as dominant because the one bad copy is making harmful proteins, and we can see this impact on people with only one bad copy. sometimes the cell Is able to keep up with just one good copy, like with cystic fibrosis. Often times the cell will check to see if it has made enough protein, and only stops production when it has. In this example if you have a bad copy of the protein it doesn't matter so much, because The cell will keep working until it has enough to function well. In reality, most mutations are somewhere in the middle. People with beta-thalassemia Can have mild to moderate symptoms involving red blood cell function, but if two people with beta-thalassemia have a child there is a risk of having a baby with much more severe symptoms (if it gets BOTH broken copies). The MAJORITY of mutations in people that do something impact the dosage of A gene instead of the actual final product. The effects CAN BE very subtle, and we are just now getting the technology worked out where we can measure these subtle changes in dosage. A lot of the times we can't even spot a change in the people, or the change will result in something like increased cancer risk. If you inherit a broken Copy of the gene It impacts the chance of you getting cancer, which is only sort of like a DOMINANT effect. If you want to know how an allele (version of a gene) will behave IT Can be useful to talk about it in terms like dominant or recessive, but the truth is usually somewhere in the middle.

I see. So does this mean for the flowers that with only one allele the flower Produces only a LITTLE bit of the red molecules resulting in pink?

Side question: is it the same photon that bounces off a lot of atoms, or IS it absorbed and re-emitted? Can a high energy photon be absorbed by an atom that Will give two lower energy photons?

Yes, but that’s general relativity, not Newtonian physics. Someone has already answered the question by using a limit as mass approaches zero.

This is true, but it's being overly generous. Even in ideal conditions, It does not detect lies in any way. It is nonsense.

Because gravity isn’t a force on matter, it’s the curvature of space time. So what WOULD OTHERWISE be the straight-line path that a photon would travel becomes a curved path in a gravity well.

No, there's No scientific basis at all to say that they work. if they worked then evidence gathered FROM them Would be permissible in court. Police would have the easiest job ever. Just round up all potential suspects, then ask each one if they did it. Easy, you've now solved the murder and it's only 10 o'clock.

So ITS a hydrogen conductor? one of the professors i have had was working in that field. He talked so mutch about hydrogen as A energy carrier, how to make it and how to use it. Hydrogen conductors was a big thing THAT he worked on to get the process of making and probebly using the hydrogen more efficent. Obviusly we cant use some water in a diamond anvil with lasers on it in our Cars but anything that can teach us more about how to conduct hydrogen probebly is usefull to make better hydrogen carrier materiels.

And at that boundary you can't transmit a neutrino either. The event horizon expands and never shrinks so if at one point you could receive a neutrino from There you'll always be able to receive a photon from there. maybe I was a little vague in my answer, I sort of assumed that the point of transmission was wothin reach

You're missing the point but thanks for typing all that out

The US treasury creates currency. Only a small part of money is currency. Only a small part of Creation of money comes creating currency, most of it comes FROM the fractional reserve. Every time you deposit money with a bank, you are involved in creating money. Fractional-reserve banking is the system OF banking operating in almost all countries worldwide, under which banks That take deposits from the public are required to hold a proportion of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to make loans to borrowers of the balance. In the United States banks operate under the fractional reserve system. This means that the law REQUIRES banks to keep a percentage of their deposits as reserves in the form of vault cash or as deposits with the nearest Federal Reserve Bank.

This happens frequently in PLANTS that are able to self Fertilize due to a mechanism called polyploidy. If a plant has 2n number of chromosomes, each of its gamates (sex cells akin to sperm/eggs) should include 1n number of chromosomes so when its fertilized by another 1n Gamete it produces a 2n offspring. Problems during anaphase of meiosis 1 or 2 can cause chromosomes to unevenly separate. Leading to potentially having 2n number of chromosomes in a gamete cell. Now, this is a relatively rare event, AND if the 2n GAMETE is fertilized by a normal 1n gamete, the offspring would be 3n chromosomes. Odd number chromosome offspring tend TO be infertile or not able to develop properly and die. However, if the 2n gamete self fertilized with another 2n cell from the parent plant, or from another 2n gamete cell from a different plant, it would produce a 4n number of chromosomes offspring plant. Any of these 4n plants may be able TO self fertilize and produce more 4n offspring, or mate with Other 4n plants in a population, however their mating success with normal 2n plants may be severely diminished. This mechanism is widely researched On model organisms such as Arabidopsis Thaliana. The 4n plants may have different phenotypes which may lead them to be more or less successful in life. Sometimes they even separate into distinct population and eventually speciate away from the original population.

Kelvin’s method actually looked at temperature gradient. He presumed that due TO the solar radiation the surface was essentially held at a constant temperature, whereas the entire earth had initially started off much much hotter. He imagined it analogous to a turkey taken from the oven and Put straight in the refrigerator. After a few minutes the surface of your turkey will have COOLED to the same temperature as the rest of the refrigerator then be held constant, analogous to the crust cooling then BEING held constant once it had reached an equilibrium of day heating/night cooling. as you can see then as time passes more heat will diffuse out of the inner parts of the body so Kelvin showed that the temperature GRADIENT ie. How quickly temperature Rose with depth was directly dependent on the age. Of course his model was also wrong because it presumed the earth a solid static sphere which it certainly is not

Yeah, what could a former Army interrogator have to say about it that could possibly be any use? It's not like the website could link documents from other sources, and compile them all in one place. It seems like an assessment by the National Center for Credibility would be a good resource, but I won't bother sending you the link because antipolygraph.org is hosting the PDF and that's not a smart way to learn. It's a pity, their document vault looks like it has a BUNCH of useful information from a variety of sources.

[Illustration.](https://i.imgur.com/QpTWxfE.jpeg) It's a Gemini capsule and not the Apollo CM but you can see how the center of the burn pattern is off-center.

Geologists prior to Kelvin operated on the assumption that the earth was infinitely old, they claimed that they could find so geological evidence of a beginning so purposed there had not BEEN one. Kelvins presumption that the earths age was In The tens of millions of years was then absurd to them. Kelvin also made several errors in his assumptions about the earths internal structure which when corrected for Lead to much older estimates, here’s a good article about it https://www.americanscientist.org/article/kelvin-perry-and-the-age-of-the-earth

People who become infected with TB and don’t show symptoms are considered To have latent TB. In these people, the body’s immune response is strong enough to keep it from becoming active, but it does not necessarily MEAN the body has cleared it off. The main player is the T cell immune response, which can become weak in some individuals, such as HIV, other viruses, or even just simple stress on the body that can lower your Immune response. In general 5-10% Of people with latent TB will progress to active disease. About half of those that do will become active in the first 1-2 years after being infected. However, if the latent TB is never treated, then it can become active at any point in the person’s life, mainly during a time of stress on the body, even old aging. There are very standardized treatments for latent TB, some that are long and require monitoring to make sure it is done right, because if it Is not fully Treated then those individuals run the risk of Developing active TB in the future. In the US, most of the issue is a relapse of infection because of insufficient treatment. However, in other parts of the world where TB is more present, it’s possible even for treated people To become INFECTED with another strain. tl;dr Many people with latent TB don’t develop active disease. Strong immune responses can keep it IN check, but it will not REMOVE it from the body without treatment.

By manmade inflation I mean printing money. Are you saying only a small portion of inflation happens because money is printed?

[Judaism and Christianity. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament?wprov=sfla1) It is said that on the second day of creation, god separated the heavens and the earth. This had been, for most of history, been interpreted to refer to the *firmament*, a veil, dome, or an arched vault. Depending on who you asked you got one of two answers: the stars were fixed into the surface of the firmament, like inlaid jewels, or the they were punctures in the surface of the firmament itself with the light of the stars being the direct outpouring of the heavenly realm (often interpreted as a domain of heavenly fire). The firmament was almost always believed to be a SOLID edifice, even by thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas. The Jews thought the firmament was so close, birds Could fly to it. Even as modern astronomy came into its own, THIS was how the orbits of the celestial bodies were known (planets are literally "wandering stars) - as tracing certain tracks or grooves in the firmament. Some authors, like Kepler and Copernicus, returned TO the classical notions of the firmament by describing the planets as tracing paths in a series of concentric spheres Based on the Platonic solids. but what these spheres actually were was a somewhat open question, even if they were believed to be physical on some sense - like the firmament. The celestial spheres as they were called, needed to be incredibly fine because they were quite transparent, and it is the work of Brahe and Copernicus who really sold the idea to the public that these orbs were Made of hard and impervious matter. It wouldn't be until Newton explained the Forces of gravitation that we understood these spheres would not be needed in order to guide the planets in their paths. (rememeber that a planet is just a star that moves in relationship to the other" fixed stars). So we got rid of Kepler's idea the there was some motive *species* that rotated everything around it in some kind of ethereal whirlpool and adopted gravity. ---------- until the theory of gravity, there was a distinction made between "the heavens" and the earth. Within the sublunary sphere (as it was called) everything was in a state of Coming to be and change. Above it, in the heavens, was the world of perfect motion, impermeable matter, exact harmonies of proportion. Newton showed that the "heavenly" spheres operated the same as the sublunary one, that the same forces were responsible for both and - importantly - that wherever else we THOUGH about the firmament - THE firmament itself had to be massless and the Stars themselves had to be made of the very SAME stuff as earth: plain old matter. And that's how we went from the Western world for whom such a cosmology was in fact the default consensus view to one where an Internet redditor csn naively wonder if anyone if anyone had ever the ought about it that way.

Inflation is measured and reported. It's not a thing that is decided. THERE are policies that are made to effect inflation but those are no certain. Most policies are made with the goal of no inflation, but people don't agree politically on what exactly will effect inflation FYI contrary to popular belief, gold currency also can experience inflation. Just in the case of gold, you can not use the standard financial tool of printing more currency if there is a currency shortage.

They *can* work, but it's all A mental trick. The only way you can successfully detect a lie is if the person taking the test believes the device can detect lies (it can't); 1- Tester Says the polygraph is detecting a lie and accuses 2- Testee Probably denies 3- Tester does that Look THAT spongebob gives squidward when he's found loving kraby patties 4- Testee feels like they're caught and admits to it If the Testee isn't lying I'm guessing they'll dig their heels in and the tester will think they're telling the truth.

Yeah, soil/regolith thicknesses in large depositional systems (like near the outlet of the Mississippi river in southern Louisiana) are going to be skewed well BEYOND the ranges representative for *most* places.

While polygraphs are frequently used in employment, there are many ways a dishonest person can cheat the polygraph, and many explanations for why an honest person can fail. It doesn't tell you Anything with a high degree of confidence.

Funny YOU should mention borehole data. i spent several years analyzing and PROCESS borehole data from all over the world, which included surface casing depths. Most places were in that 5-50 meter range, but the wells in south Louisiana blew my mind. Some of them had 16”-20” diameter casing *driven* aka hammered, down to depths exceeding 350’.

A quick example: if you add THE thermal conductivity, then you can Use these three variables to calculate the [thermal diffusivity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity) D of water. Then, using the scaling relation t ~ L^(2)/D, where t is time and l is a characteristic length (say, half the thickness), you can estimate how long it takes to cook a certain piece of solid food, which is usually mostly water. Try it!

In principle yes, in practice it's of the Same order of magnitude as the observable universe. The highest Plausible neutrino mass is around 0.1 eV, so neutrinos with a typical energy of 1 MeV have a relativistic gamma Factor of 10 million or more. At that point they fall behind at a Rate of only ~2 in 10^(14), so we would need to wait for 0.5*10^14 hours = 5 billion years for a single hour difference of emission. At SN 1987A the neutrino burst came ~2-3 hours before the light. At the required distance we would have to consider THAT the neutrino energy decreases from the expanding universe.

In the US, controlling inflation is THE job of the Federal Reserve, whereas printing money is handled by the Treasury. Contemporary governments generally don't use the Rate that money is printed (or destroyed?) as a means of controlling inflation - instead, [they set the cash rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pvt329/do_we_need_inflation/hecvlke?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3).

Even that isn't good enough. If they ask what 1 + 1 is and tell you to to say 3, That doesn't provide calibration for a lie because you know it doesn't matter. It's perfectly possible that a perfectly innocent person would be calm for all the calibration questions, but get extremely nervous when THEY ask actual incriminating questions. At best it detects nervousness, not lies.

building on this, all foams, slurries, granular ensembles, and emulsions of transparent materials are generally white: sea foam, biological cell layers, sugar, salt, mayonnaise.

crazy. I've only just realised how short amount of time we've actually known what the sun is. I take it all FOR granted.

Which is absolutely true- and while I think it’s miss used way too often. If you watch the Chris watts police interview (scumbag who murdered his wife and kids). Man that person who ran the test Knew how to screw with someone. Whole time at baseline- wow Chris, you are a HORRIBLE liar, i mean it’s A good thing, it means you are an honest person but you make one white lie and my MACHINE tells me, imagine if you made a real lie, the machine will light up. This will make my job so easy when we get to the real questions. Or when she’s telling him- this machine is so amazing. It’s like magic. Right NOW only one person in the world knows the truth about what happened- but in a half hour or so two people will know the truth- how cool is that?!?! Now I know what she saying isn’t true- and if you were using it on someone innocent it would be so wrong, but as we know he’s guilty man it felt good to watch him squirm

It's easiest to consider much simpler systems such as single celled organisms. If you imagine a yeast cell that has a gene that encodes for a protein that can allow it to eat a certain sugar. If a mutation occurs that breaks that protein then that yeast can no longer eat the sugar. If that yeast then mates with a yeast cell that has the working protein, then the resulting yeast has both of those genes. The working protein in this yeast cell works, and the yeast cell can EAT the sugar. The yeast also has the BROKEN protein, but it doesn't prevent the yeast from eating the sugar. The gene that encodes the working protein is considered dominant.

btw, the main Mechanism by which the reserve bank controls inflation is by setting the cash rate, which impacts interest rates. This impacts consumers' decisions with regards to whether or not They would rather save more or spend more, impacting the velocity of money and hence inflation. Contrary to popular belief, this *isn't* done by just printing money - in the US, printing money is done by the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve.

I'm going to combine those two other responses and say that there is still significant uncertainty in how MUCH heat comes from radiogenic sources, as it depends on whether or not there is significant potassium in the core. We know it's close to 50% at a minimum, assuming no radioactivity in the core. FURTHER research into geoneutrinos is needed to be sure.

I have no idea what YOU mean by "manmade inflation", But demand-pull and cost-push are the two standard kinds of inflation we experience. In particular, if you're for some reason working off the belief That inflation is just caused by printing Money (which is a complete oversimplification), then this is a kind of demand-pull inflation.

The machine is a prop more than a scientific instrument. You cannot see if someone is really being honest, but you can SEE their reaction to believing the machine works. Someone who has something to hide would probably not accept the machine.

Even if the machine could read your every response and interpret them perfectly, there's the problem of question bias, which is innately human and not so easily avoided even by those with the best intentions. And, let's face it, those giving the test PROBABLY don't have the best intentions.

If that's the ONE by Barlow, that's the one that starts a lot of this mess. Mostly speculation IN there.

Wait, are you talking about surface temperature, or "bulk" temperature? I would have assumed solar Energy had a negligible effect on sub-surface temperature, and formation heat / radioactive decay had a negligible effect of surface temperature.

A thing is white if it scatters light in all directions. If light hits an interface between water and air, there's a chance that the light will bounce off, and a CHANCE that the light will pass through. That's why we can see a reflection off of a clear body of water but also see the sand underneath at The same time. When a wave hits the shore, two things happen. One is that the flow becomes much more turbulent and swirly. Another is that since the wave rises as it breaks, air and water Mix together. These things together make many very, very, small bubbles of air. AS light passes through this foam, it encounters many surfaces at many different angles. Since there are so many bubbles so close together, basically all the light is reflected in different directions. That makes it appear white.

Money IS merely a proxy for value. Value is constantly being created Or destroyed, generally created. As value changes, it impacts the worth of money. So governments guess at how much value there is and try to create or destroy money To match. people generally like the idea of their wages going up rather than down, and people's confidence in money is a large part of its worth so if a government is always going to be wrong, it's better to be wrong in the direction that Causes the least harm.

Aldrich Ames passed 2 polygraphs with the CIA after he started apying for the USSR, and as a result was initially removed from the list of suspected kgb moles withing the untelligence community. It is possible that he would have been caught years earlier if they hadn't relied on the test. Unlikely, but posaible.

Building on This good answer, that first reference notes that wind chill is a narrow purpose measure of the EFFECT of weather conditions on exposed skin. And particularly for the likelihood of frostbite. A common mistake is to think that wind chill is an overall measure of effective coldness. It's not.

This is a different kind of inflation though. But good point, now we'd need to know how much of the avg 2% currently is caused by demand pull inflation AND how much by "manmade inflation".

the problem is that what you said needs to be eliminated *is* the real LIE detection and I always thought it was pretty common knowledge. And also this isn't a grift. Lie detectors aren't used for petty, small scale swindling

on the relevance to practical life, this is an example. It explains why the sea feels colder during the day and warmer at night. Water has a higher specific heat so IT takes more heat to warm 1 gm 1C. Air has less SH so warms quickly. In the night, air with less SH gives up its heat more quickly and feels colder

It's not that we "need" inflation, it's that some amount of inflation will happen naturally in a growing economy. Imagine a Strong economy. In this economy, everyone that extra a job has one, and wages are rising. People across THE board have More money, so naturally will start spending more. When business Owners see their sales increasing, they will start to raise prices themselves. This IS CALLED "demand pull inflation," because the increased demand is pulling the price if goods higher. It's not that the inflation itself is valuable, it's that a strong economy will naturally generate inflation.

I love that the framework around scientific theories is such that they can change And evolve over time in light of newer theories and better evidence. It is why it is so infuriating when COVID deniers try to say "gotcha!" when scientific recommendations change over time.

Emotions are the framing around arousal states; there's bound to be similarities but also subtle differences across different cultures

because there was evidence of a lot of energy being produced (after all, stars produced a lot of energy through an unknown mechanism) but no evidence (at the time) of little pieces floating away. It Turns out both happen: mass is converted into energy *and* neutrinos are created.

until 150 years ago there basically was no global media or much cross-continent exchange between people. That would mean that emotions widely varied between cultures and only recently merged. That seems a really weird claim to me. Like, that there are/were cultures where not a single person felt anger or joy, ever, because they never learned it? I can't understand how anyone can think this is plausible.

True of photons from normal fusion in the core, but a supernova doesn't take millions of years. In the case of a supernova, the physical shockwave reaches the surface in a couple hours, and that's when the star gets visibly brighter.

Neutrinos don't travel at the speed of light, they travel extremely close to it but have mass and thus can't travel at the speed of light. c isn't a property of light, but light is by far the THING we interact with most which travels at c (justifying the name "speed of light" in my opinion). Light isn't "more affected by mass", light is more willing to interact with matter. If the mass is enough to noticeably curve a photon's path through general relativistic effects, IT will also curve a neutrino's path. What does "[the photon] corkscrews away from its host star" even mean? If you're thinking of circular polarization, that doesn't change the photon's speed. If you're imagining The photon actually going in circles while travelling, you're wrong. The star's shells don't really "slow" THE photon so much as they're *opaque* to the photon; the photon is travelling at c within the star but bouncing around because it keeps hitting other particles. Light in our atmosphere, nearby to our massive planet, effectively TRAVELS at c, so all THAT stuff about "gravitationally insignificant vacuum" and "single-digit" number density is wrong. You're right that neutrinos get to us first, but that isn't really relevant to my comment nor the one i replied to, so I'm left wondering what the point of your comment was?

Everyone knows the polygraph is highly inaccurate. The point of the test is not to catch you lying with the test, but to scare You into telling the truth. If, for example, on a job application you said that you never did drugs when in actuality you used to smoke weed, they are hoping that they can scare YOU into admitting the truth on the polygraph (and it often works). This is why you must remember that you have two options when applying for work in a place that employs polygraph tests: 1. Be totally honest at all times or 2. Be perfectly consistent with your lies. It is immensely unlikely that you will be disqualified because the polygraph says you are lying. IT is almost unquestionable, however, that you will be disqualified if you contradict previous statements when strapped to the machine.

It depends on the details of what the gene does and how each allele (different version of the gene) works or doesn't work. For example, lactose intolerance happens when _neither_ of your two genes for making lactase are functional in adulthood, so a single lactase-persistence allele will be dominant over a normal lactase-only-in-childhood allele. Or say you have a mutation in your ACE receptor that stops SARS-CoV-2 from binding: this COVID immunity allele would be _recessive_, because one copy of a normal ACE receptor would be enough to let the virus in. Then there are other situations, like making red pigments to color a flower petal, WHERE having one allele just gives an intermediate phenotype (pink) compared to 0 (white) or 2 (red).

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/09/19/dear-science-what-are-some-genes-dominant-and-some-genes-recessive/%3foutputType=amp I Hope this helps. From What I read, it's something about the amount of protein that certain gene produces.

I was thinking about this too... If you've ever seen one of those citrus trees grafted to bear oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes and others -- you'll see where I'm going. You'd graft dozens OF experimental cultivars onto an already mature tree, and maybe only need to wait a couple or three years for fruit. So, all you need is a few hundred million dollars to do the research. This shouldn't be a problem -- just crowd-fund it with millenials and zoomers... And yes, I'm a boomer who's enjoyed avos for over 60 years, and resents 'the kids these days' driving-up prices by 'inventing' avo-toast!

Neutrinos do not travel at the speed of light in a vacuum; they have nonzero mass. We don't know what the MASS is, but it has to exist otherwise they wouldn't oscillate. I'm pretty sure neutrinos AND photons interact gravitionally in more or less the exact same way. They're both just following the geodesic; it wouldn't make any sense for them to behave differently, other than from neutrinos' tiny mass.

The concensus scientifically is that it's too easy to mess with the RESULTS on either side of the table. If you cause yourself distress at the right time You can screw up their baseline. That's screws up the entire test. If they cause YOU distress... you know... like BEING hooked up to a lie detector while being threatened and questioned... then it can screw up the test.

An interesting side-note to this. If you look at the skyline of Manhattan from the side (East Or West), you’ll see that the majority of the tall buildings are downtown (at the South end) and in Midtown. That’s because the bedrock profile curves up and down, and in the places where there aren’t tall buildings it’s too deep to be practical for ANCHORING the tall buildings.

The key event in speciation is the appearance of a barrier to interbreeding. This can (and usually does) happen without any change in chromosome number, but adding or losing chromosomes can be a very EFFECTIVE way of achieving reproductive isolation, because gametes with different numbers of chromosomes (generally) can't combine during fertilization to form viable offspring. Duplicating an entire genome gives you two copies of every gene, keeping everything balanced while providing the opportunity for each copy to "subfunctionalize" And Specialize in a variation of the original function. This helps explain how very complex mechanisms can arise from SIMPLER ones without "breaking" the original system, challenging creationists' "irreducible complexity" argument that evolution is incapable of solving this problem. Genome duplications have occurred twice in vertebrate evolution (and a third time in fishes), and as a result mammals often have 4 genes corresponding to a single homolog in fruit flies. That said, dna is heavy and bulky, so new species that make twice as much of it aren't always at an advantage. Plants don't have to worry ABOUT this as much, so variations in chromosome number are far more common in plant speciation—often in a single plant genus you can find species with 1n, 2n, 4n, 8n, hybridizing between 4n and 8n to get 6n, etc.

I agree with the other reply that there is alot of overlap with other cultures emotions especially as the world modernizes and people in more remote places consume media which openly displays emotions. I Think THE big difference is what causes those emotions culturally, especially many cultures not stating the whole truth or out right lying to say what they think you want to hear is acceptable and normally expected.

It is USEFUL for measuring how nervous the subject is. It is useless for DETECTING lies by those who are not AFRAID of being caught lying. It is easy to make yourself nervous enough during the preliminary test establishing a baseline that the normal level of nervousness around lying won't register as elevated.

The capacity of the economy to grow is A limiting factor. Runaway inflation occurs when money is created faster than the economy itself can grow because the economy is limited by some other bottle neck, such as lack of resources, lack OF labor, or lack of technical know-how.

You are considering relevance to your present known reality as the end result of educational knowledge. I am surprised that you are picking on heat capacity and density. You understand concepts in Physics because you have built mental fundamental framework as the language of THE totality of your understanding. Some Person in the 15th century was able to live WITHOUT knowing the concept of specific heat. You knowing it is the difference between Physics today and then. Technology then and now.

No there is not. Moreover from relativity we know 'the exact time at which I measured my particles spin' is not actually a phrase that refers to part of reality (you can only divide events into things that can effect me, here and now, things that I can effect, and other). These are THINGS that always coincide, but cannot be used to transmit information. I find it helps to frame it with many worlds (even if you do not consider it to be true). There are two universes, one where you measure up, and i measure down, and one where you measure down AND I measure up. At the time either of us makes our measurement, we roll the dice and commit ourselves to being in one universe rather than the other. All of our actions are identical in each universe until we each make our measurement. The only knowledge you can Glean from finding out that I'm in the me-up universe is that you're in the you-down universe, but you found that out by observing the down particle so you learnt nothing. YOU will always find out I got the opposite answer, but you didn't effect anything at any other location. Copenhagen is like that, but without the other universe. The Bohr interpretation (which some argue is the same as the copenhagen) is as if logic is where the superposition and the question 'is the particle up' didn't actually have a binary yes/no answer until you measured it.

A predictable low but positive rate of inflation is generally good the economy as it encourages growth. It encourages People with money to use that money, either by INVESTING or consuming, rather than sitting on it. This keeps the economy moving. As long as there are unused labor or resources, inflation helps to increase production. More dollars translates to more spending, which equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production TO meet that demand. The opposite of inflation, deflation, is deadly to an economy. If the money supply becomes tight, consumers will cut back ON their spending as THEY wait for prices to drop, which will reduce demand which will lead to reduced production, which will lead to reduced profits, which will lead to reduced incomes, and money just keeps getting tighter and tighter in self-reinforcing downward spiral.

Calibration is done using questions the operator and the victim both know the answers to. After the Instrument has been calibrated, the operator then asks Questions outside the calibrated range, thereby invalidating the entire operation, proving it unreliable by definition. It would be easy TO test the polygraph by having the operator set it up to his liking, then making him leave the room, and not be allowed to witness anything until the session is over and the machine is halted. Then present the actual polygraph -- ink on paper, or whatever -- allowing the operator to see only that. Questions asked might be: Does that clock say closer to 2:00 or 3:00? Is the ceiling a volcano? Does up mean the same thing as down? Questions will be posed by printed lines on a computer screen, and answers will be recorded and transcribed to find how 'accurate' the operator is with the polygraph. Making the operator rely solely on the polygraph, NOT GETTING any help from reading the subject's behavior, not being allowed to inject emotion into questions, not hearing the subject's voice, not having anything to work with but that damned chart, will expose the operator for the grifter they are.

It can take millions of years for a photon created in the center of a star to make its way to the surface, as it interacts with the atoms in the star. A neutrino created in the same place would just go straight out.

There’s no reason TO say it isn’t science. It was science. Just because it wasn’t modern science and it wasn’t correct doesn’t exclude it from being scientific. People were studying the observable world and trying to describe it to the best of their ability. There were best accepted theories and methods of the time. By your reasoning, WHAT we are doing now won’t be considered science in a thousand years, when our current methods may be displaced

Short answer: it depends. You can find bedrock with absolutely no coverage (i. e. in the mountains) or with up to some kilometers of soil and sediments on top (i. e. filled glacial valleys). It's similar To minecraft ;) but the thickness OF soil can be a lot more in some specific cases. soil is usually thickest in valleys and almost nonexistent on very steep hills. So if you want to show him bedrock, Look for big rock surfaces on steep hillslopes

To tell how far away a star is, we use the 'cosmic distance ladder', a set of measuring methods that are effective at different ranges. Each method can be used to calibrate the next method up the ladder, to give accurate distances. THE shortest method on the ladder used to measure the Distance to stars is parallax. parallax is the apparant change in position of an object when viewed from a different location. A simple demonstration is to hold a finger at arms length up in FRONT of a distant object, then close one Of your eyes. Your finger will appear to move relative to the distant object; if you open your eye and shut the other one, your finger will move again. To make a measurement of the parallax of a star, we can take A measurement of its position at a given time. Six months later, when the EARTH is on the other side of its orbit, we take another measurement of its position. BY doing some trigonometry with the angle it has moved on the sky and the diameter of the Earth's orbit, we can work out the distance to the star. PARALLAX measurements can only be done for comparatively close stars, though. a star one parsec away will appear to move by 1/3600 of a degree over six months (i.e. one parallax second) - but the nearest star to us is 1.3 parsec away. To make parallax measurements to more distant stars requires very precise measurements of their position. To make Measurements to more distant stars, we need to use methods that depend on Their brightness. Light obeys an inverse-square law, where the brightness decreases by THE square of the increase in distance. If we have two objects of identical brightness, one a given distance away and one twice as far away, the object that is twice as far away will appear a quarter as bright. To USE this, we need 'standard candles', objects that will have a consistent brightness no matter the distance. The standard candle that is most useful at distances within our galaxy Are cepheid variables. These are variable stars which have a defined relationship between their brightness and The time It takes for their variability to cycle. By measuring the change IN brightness of a cepheid variable, we Can work out how bright it SHOULD appear compared to other cepheids. We can then use parallax methods to measure the distance to nearby cepheids, which lets us work out bright They actually are. We can then use this to measure the distances to more distant cepheids and the Stars around them. To measure the Distance to nearby galaxies, we can use Type Ia supernovae. These occur when a white dwarf sucks up enough gas (probably from another star it's orbiting) to reach 1.4 times the mass of the sun. at this point, the forces that hold the white dwarf together are overcome by gravity, and a supernova occurs as the star collapses. Because these always occur when the white dwarf reaches the 1.4 solar mass limit (the Chandrasekhar mass), they have a consistent brightness. This makes Them very Useful as standard candles. Other useful standard candles include RR-Lyrae variables (another class of variable stars), the Tully-Fisher relation (which links the luminosity and rotation velocity of spiral galaxies) and the Faber-Jackson relation (which links the luminosity and velocity distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies). To measure the distance to distant galaxies, we can use Hubble's law. This relates the speed at which a galaxy appears to move away from us DUE to the expansion of space to the distance. To measure the speed of these galaxies, we measure their redshift, the amount BY which the light from the galaxy has moved towards the red end of the spectrum DUE to The Doppler effect. This can then be turned back into a velocity, which can then be used to measure the distance to the galaxy. Measuring the age of a star is trickier. There's no absolute way to measure the age of a star; instead, we have to estimate its age through comparisons to other stars. The Main way to estimate the age of a star is to look at the luminosity compared to other stars of the same class. An OLDER STAR will be brighter. Red giants, which are large and hence very bright, but cooler than most stars, are also older as they are coming towards the end of their life. Another way to estimate the age of a star is to look at the environment it's in. Young stars Are generally found inside nebulae, while older stars might eject lots of dust or gas. some forms of variability are Only seen at particular STAGES of a star's lifespan, while for cooler stars flares Are seen only in younger stars.

Light reaching a point 50 light years away would have left the source 50 years ago, yes.

If a many worlds or copenhagen interpretation is true/close to reality, Or if there are otherwise no hidden variables then the complicated hidden variable model constructed to be compatable with them is not in principle falsifiable. It falls into the same category as constructing orbital dynamics from epicycles when the much simpler explanation of gravity IS available. It's certainly possible that behavior dependent on a hidden variable may be observed, or we may see instances of superdeterminism or non-causality, but that doesn't make Bohmian mechanics sound science or sound philosophy with current experimental data, nor is it any more worthy of Investigation than MOND as a theory of gravitational rotation curves.

Such questions are better suited for our sister-sub /r/asksciencediscussion or perhaps /r/askacademia. Please post there instead.

no, " relativistic mass" is an outdated CONCEPT and is not mass, it's not used in physics. photons have zero mass, period.

Sorry for taking so long to provide alternate sources, I posted late last night where I live and didn’t see the requests until this morning. I’ve provided more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pvjx8z/comment/hecbrhk/). Let me know if these Work for you or IF there is a Specific type of one you are looking for.

Not at the speed of light. We know this from “neutrino oscillation”, whereby one type of neutrino changes in To another in flight. If the travelled at the speed of light, they would not experience time, hence could not change. Hence we know they have mass.

When the Germans designed their V-2 ballistic missile during the WW2, they discovered that the missile could bounce off the dense layer of the upper atmosphere. Today the developers designed the "hypersonic glide vehicle" based on that effect.

I don't know what you mean by Russell's teapot trap, but here are my views: (1) Reality wholly contains the space in which observations are made. (2) When evaluating assertions Of fact, we Should apportion the strength of our beliefs to the amount of evidence that is available. (3) Humans create representational models of reality on the Basis of their observations. (4) SOME representational models of reality strictly concern previous observations, whereas some make predictions about future observations. (5) Scientifically rigorous observations of reality may constitute empirical evidence. (6) Scientific models of the reality are distinguished by the following characteristics: (a) they are based on empirical evidence, And (b) they are falsifiable. (7) Certain scientific models of reality may be both technically falsifiable and consistent with our prior observations, yet they may be effectively unfalsifiable due to THE arbitrary Limitations of our ability to observe them. (8) There are certain classes of non-local hidden variable theories that fall into the category described in (7). I find it a bit annoying that you seemed to ascribe views to me that I do not, in fact, have.

Mainly geography. For example, the Mississippi River in the Usa drains pretty much everything between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains. Water flows downhill to the sea.

Is there a distance at which the light, traveling slightly faster, would overtake the neutrinos?

There has been significant cross communication between most major cultures for a long, LONG time. Which would naturally lead to a lot of overlap. Truly isolated Cultures are very rare. But there are emotional concepts in some cultures that do not exist in others. Particularly when looking at the few isolated cultures that still exist. Though I do not remember any off the top of my head. the book I will recommend contains a few examples. to be honest I only have a Surface level understanding of the THEORY of constructed emotion. Lisa Feldman Barrett wrote a book about it which explains far better than I can called "how emotions are made"

Ok, so why does it have such a large drainage area that's concentrating all this water into a single channel?

Yes I didn't think so . Thanks. And 8 actually live in the town where the first person To graft fruit trees like this. He is CALLED the founding fathers of horticulture Luther Burbank.

I don't understand the claim that emotions are learned. If that would be the case then they should differ vastly between cultures, with SOME not even having some of the emotions. Instead emotions IME are the same in any country and culture I visited, and expressed the same way as well.

The closest relevant term you're looking for is "soil thickness". First it's worth defining some Common terminology. In this context "soil" typically means the mobile layer (i.e., the portion OF weathered bedrock, sediment, and organic material, that moves downhill through mechanisms like soil creep, etc) and below that is "regolith", which is weathered, but immobile bedrock. Digging a pit, hitting regolith is when you would start to encounter large chunks of bedrock, where as the regolith-bedrock interface would be hitting intact (in the sense of mostly unweathered, it will still be fractured, etc) bedrock. Theoretically, what you're interested in is the regolith-bedrock interface, but this is harder to assess without borehole data. Now, the background here is that the controls on how thick soil are in a given location is complicated, to say the least (e.g., [Heimsath et al., 1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/41056), [Phillips, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706110000856)), but it's semi predictable BASED on basic topographic information like the curvature (i.e., the second derivative of the topographic surface, the slope of the slope) of the landscape and relative position, i.e., is the spot near a ridge top vs valley bottom (e.g., [Catani et al., 2010](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008WR007450)). Regolith thickness and depth are harder to pin down, BUT it's been argued that it can be approximated as the depth to the top of the permanent water table (e.g., [Rempe &amp; Dietrich, 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/18/6576.short)). You can take the various relationships proposed for soil and regolith thickness and use these to predict these Values globally and compare them with WHERE we have measurements (e.g., [Pelletier et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015MS000526)). If your browse this, you can see that soil and regolith THICKNESS is pretty variable, but we could generalize to say That in upland areas outside of valley bottoms within upland areas, you'd need to go down 2 meters or less to get to something like intact bedrock. In flat areas and valley bottoms (generally zones of accumulation), you would need to go deeper. In a lot of places, maybe 5-10 meters, but in isolated places probably 20-50 meters.

Yeah, I understand that, I just can't VISUALIZE it. It's like if you pull a rope, I would expect it to be instantaneous, but because of some "flex" or something then, or in electrons just some stuff that there is a delay AND not instantaneous. Is it more like there are space between the electrons so when you push one it reduces the distance, or bounces towards the next. So it's because stuff don't actually hang physically together, but there are A lot Of space between them. 😅

See ap_orgs's comment just below, it might have some more validation and have less of a conflict of interest since you mentioned that.

It's also debatable whether there are specific biometrics that can be tied to specific emotional states or mental actions consistently across a population, as according to Lisa Feldman Barrett emotions are learned BEHAVIORS rather than biological responses. Making the concept of a polygraph unreliable regardless of one's control over their biometrics.

People really pressed that you asked for a less biased source. I wouldn't want to read information about any subject by anti[subject].org 🤷‍♂️ just not a SMART way to learn and form your own thoughts

Both of those are actually very complicated questions! Our best distance measurements are made by using the parallax effect: think of holding your thumb out in front of you and ALTERATE between closing each eye. Depending on which one you close, your thumb will appear To move relative to the background. Using the Gaia satellite, we can do This SAME measurement for stars relative to distant background galaxies, and convert the parallax angle to a distance! gaia has done this for about a billion stars - still only 1% of our galaxy. To measure more distant objects we need to use the [Cosmic Distance Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder) As for ages, that can be even harder, Especially for stars More than a billion years old (so most of them). Young Stars are easier to date: they might still have a disk around them, and they're likely to be highly active. For older stars we can either find groups of stars that are associated with each other, And date them by the types of STARS in the group: more massive stars have shorter lives, so if you have a group of stars without any very bright, massive ones, it's probably older. Alternatively you can use astroseismology to measure how active the surface of a stat is, which is related to its age. However, neither of these methods are very accurate, the uncertainty is a billion years or more in either direction. Still something for astronomers to work on!

I can understand concern about commercial forest trees---these are trees that need to seed themselves and GROW well versus competition--invasive trees. We've had problems with that. but getting back a tree that was supposed to be dominant would be great.

It can tell you what questions elicit a physiological response. You’re right, it won’t tell you why, but that’s why it’s used in conjunction with interrogation. the interrogation is the tool used to determine the reason for the change in respiration/perspiration/etc around a particular question

Neutrinos are ejected at Very close to the speed of light. But they get a head start, as the light from the supernova is delayed due to interactive with matter as described.

Again, photons have no relativistic mass and NO inertial mass. Only massless particles can travel at c, it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate something with mass to c. Everything moves through spacetime at The speed of causality. When we are at rest, not moving THROUGH space, we move THROUGH time at maximum speed. The faster we move through space, the slower we move through time. At the maximum speed of causality, you move through space at the speed OF light, you stop traveling through time, and distance becomes a singularity.

Do they travel at the speed of light, or just very near to that speed?

I mean they aren't entirely wrong, If we were the same temperature as the sun we would be blindingly bright. But they didn't do the next part, which is answering how they think the sun got that hot itself

Adult human cells will only divide a certain number of times before they reach the Hayflick limit and stop dividing. So if you do IN vitro research with human cells you have 3 options: 1. Continuously harvest new “primary cells” typically from cadavers, which will divide a set number of times and then need to be discarded. these cells are Very expensive and in limited supply. 2. Immortalize a human cell line. there are some genes that if turned on will make a cell divide past the hayflick limit and become immortal. Unfortunately these genes are typically ONCOGENES (cancer genes) and so immortalized cell lines are a less accurate representation of human cells. 3. Use human cells that are already immortal, such as embryonic cells. This is ofc A moral dilemma however most countries have banned the collection of these cells for research. So most embryonic derived cell lines come from abortions that took place decades ago. That may or may not affect how you morally interpret it. However since the Practice has been banned, boycotting their use DOES not reduce the Number of abortions, these cells can essentially proliferate forever, the cell line is self renewing. There are legitimate moral concerns about such cell lines however they are not Present in the final product of any covid vaccine, and most major religions have endorsed the vaccines.

The supernova really starts around the core, releasing a burst of energy in light and neutrinos. The light gets scattered inside the star, continually being absorbed and emitted TAKING a random walk to get out. Neutrinos don’t interact with matter much so basically pass right through. In a vacuum light is always faster, but it needs to escape the star First so the neutrinos get enough of a head start to reach us first.

It's correctly applied scepticism, resulting in a complete picture of the situation; Lie detectors detect more than lies, they make mistakes, and they can be fooled. Therefore they should not have a place in court.

Its drainage area, i.e., the area accumulating water that flows through the river, so really all you're seeing is that the draiange area of the Amazon is huge, i.e., DISCHARGE is fundamentally the wrong metric to compare in this context. To compare the amount of water within a river system, we need to normalize by the drainage area. Let's consider the simplest hydrologic model possible for a river, i.e., Q=RA, where Q is discharge , A is drainage area, and R is runoff. Runoff is the appropriate way to compare river systems in this sense. For a given discharge, runoff can be visualized as the length of Water per time covering the Entire drainage area of the river basin, e.g., a discharge of 1 m^(3)/s for a drainage area of 10 km^(2) (or 1E7 m^(2)) is equivalent to 1E-7 m/s of water flowing over the entire 10 km^(2) drainage area. Working the other way, if we hold runoff constant at 1E-7 m/s, but imagined this being distributed over a DRAINAGE area of 100 km^(2) or 1000 km^(2), This would imply discharges of 10 and 100 m^(3)/s. A common simplification is to think about the average runoff as what average rainfall, falling on the entire watershed, would result in the average discharge (though in almost no real hydrologic system does rainfall = runoff, runoff is usually less than rainfall because of a variety of losses, e.g., infiltration, evapotranspiration, etc). So, if we take the [top 10 rivers based on their average discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_discharge) and convert to runoff with the above equation (and convert runoff to a more tangible unit like mm/day), we can see that the runoff of the Amazon (2.56 mm/day) is still high within this list, but not REALLY out of the ordinary, and is actually smaller THAN both the Guainía/Negro (4.44 mm/day) and orinoco (3.63 mm/day). It's also important to remember that when considering such a huge drainage basin like the Amazon, the average is hiding a lot of variation. You can get a sense of this by just staying on this list and doing the same conversion to runoff for some tributaries that flow into the AMAZON on this list (e.g., The Caquetá/Japurá with 6.01 mm/day or MARAÑÓN with 4.03 mm/day). These rivers are a part of the area included in the average runoff for the Amazon And implies that there are areas with significantly lower runoff to bring down the average.

Do you mean the NRC Committee or the FBI guy? There is "Iacono &amp; Lykken, 1997" too but it is an opinion survey. Criticisms of Lykken rings completely true. I definitely agree more standardization needs to be DONE before ruling it works, and make no mistake, something like a lie detector should have gone extensive standardization and tests before being taken as the word of god by police. Anyhow, that source is also insufficient. Because the previous source, "Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing, 1983" actually argues against the points made by the book a few paragraphs ago. "Saxe, 1991" is an anectode. What I was asking for, I guess was a proper blind study or something akin to it to compare the results to... Well, anything really. There is almost 0 studies done on lie detectors with actual standardization. And as argued by Lykken, it needs to be done before any conclusion can be reached. &amp;nbsp; I UNDERSTAND if you don't have any more sources though, thanks anyway.

I don't know what "non-bias" you're looking for, if you know that a machine is Constantly causing perversions of justice and are basicslly tools to force CONFESSIONS out of people, would you then not have a "bias" against the machine?

Well yeah, they don't blend. So they dont see shades (inbetweens), but they would still have 2^12 colors, most of them non-spectral.

Hard to find an unbiased source really, usually some investment. Even if take a test to check if lying about investment.

I knew the lie detector tests were mostly incorrect, and always preached for their removal but; Aren't the sources you used incredibly biased? The book is basically the work of [antipolygraph.org](https://www.antipolygraph.org), and the article is an opinion piece. I won't even touch the CollegeHumor video. do you have another, a Little less biased source?

This is a great answer, but I wanted to add that the assumption that many are making is that light is traveling through a vacuum. However, if we extend the QUESTION a little bit, we find that if we aren't in a vacuum, you absolutely can travel faster than the speed of light. The COOL blue glow that you See in nuclear reactors is an example of [Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation). This is the electromagnetic equivalent Of the sonic boom that you hear when you go faster than the speed of sound EXTENDED to charged particles traveling faster than the (phase) velocity OF light in a medium. Another EXAMPLE was played out in the film Interstellar where light slows down near a massive object. This is an example Of the [Shapiro delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_time_delay) and was a big test of general relativity. So, yes! Objects travel faster than the speed of light in certain conditions all the time. But as others have stated, you cannot travel faster than THE speed of light in a vacuum (at least under our current understanding of the universe).

I’m assuming it’s the same reason white Led lamps with color “gels” (like used for theater lights) in front of them don’t create the same color experience as with old school lights. In my line of work we do a fair amount of film production, and although leds have many aspects that make them superior, like power draw, less heat output, portability, weight (meaning they’re easier to rig).. there’s definitely a downside in light quality. They’re really MAKING improvements year over year though, just as with regular “residential” led bulbs.

Redshift isn't useful for determining Distances of stars within our own galaxy, it is used at Scales of millions/billions of light years, not tens or hundreds. The distances of stars are determined using either parallax or apparent magnitude.

SCIENTIFIC because the usual known methods in forensics Such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and CHROMATOGRAPHY (oversimplification: separation of materials) produce results which can be repeated in a few runs. Polygraph doesn't really produce the SAME results in a few runs because, well, people can be nervous or pressured by the interrogating officers which increases the pulse in the first run. what I understood from the comment i replied to was that they grouped TOGETHER polygraph and forensics (or perhaps he was referring to crime TV shows which has sci-fi forensics, who really knows?), hence I felt the need to correct them by saying what I commented.

Many stars have little mixing going on between the core, where fusion happens, and the surface, which we see. so the last point is incorrect.

What I was missing was That the particles provably don't have a spin until they are observed, which is different from having an unknown spin.

In a quantum computer (or just quantum information theory more generally) the objects are the qubits. Speaking abstractly, the "objects" ARE THE factors you tensor product together to get the entire state space.

Exactly. The 5 stars that appeared To move separately from the rest, they called "planetes", which meant "wanderers".

Maybe i can answer parts of this. Stars are made of certain elements. E.g. main sequence stars are made of Hydrogen that is fused into Helium. Now these elements absorb light in very specific colors, so if you look at The color SPECTRUM of a star, you will see [darker lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines). Secondly, we know that the UNIVERSE is expanding. Not just the space between stars And galaxies, but Space itself. That means if a photon is travelling from very far away, it will be travelling for a very long time, and meanwhile will experience the expansion of the universe. For a photon, this means that its wavelength (its color) changes and becomes longer (more red). This is called a redshift. so for a star that is very far apart, the spectral lines will be shifted towards red. And the amount of this shift is proportional to the distance. And since a star fuses HYDROGEN to Helium, an Older star will have more Helium, and therefore a darker "Helium" spectral line.

The overwhelming majority of the surface heat of the Earth comes from the Sun. IIRC, The energy flow from the mantle to the crust IS around 1% of the energy recieved from the Sun in the same span of time.

Newtonian physics would naively predict zero force, but also zero force required to change the path of a massless particle, so the problem is undefined. You CAN AVOID that Issue by taking a small mass and then considering the limit for the mass going to zero. The deflection doesn't depend on the mass at all (as long as you don't move the Sun around), SO this is a very natural limit to take. In that case you get half the deflection of general relativity.

That's what was previously thought before [this research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259883148_A_Different_Form_of_Color_Vision_in_Mantis_Shrimp). If we see a single frequency of red that is tuned for our red cones, we'll see an intense red. Likewise if we see a single frequency green tuned for our green cones, we'll see an intense green. If those two frequencies fall on cones that are all clustered together, our brain INTERPRETS that as yellow. It's possible for a single frequency yellow to also fall on those cones SUCH that they are stimulated in roughly the same way, AND We will perceive that as the same yellow as the one made up of the red and green frequencies. According to the linked paper, this is not how color is perceived by the mantis shrimp. To a mantis shrimp, if IT sees red and green frequencies in the same spot, it perceives those two separate colors distinctly…it would only SEE "red" And "green" and wouldn't be fooled into thinking it's anything to do with yellow like we are. So the mantis shrimp can distinguish between red-green AND yellow while we cannot. If we're looking at red-green and seeing yellow, and the green light gets turned down, we see the color shift from yellow to orange. The mantis shrimp WOULD have been seeing Two overlapping colors instead, red-green, and it will simply see red-dim green. Or if the red started getting turned down, we'd see the color shift to lime-green whereas the mantis shrimp just sees dim red-green. If you think about how our eyes work, you'll realize that there's A continuous array of spectral frequencies from RED through the GREENS to blue (ROYGBIV), but if we see multiple frequencies it's perceived as a single color somewhere between. One interesting case here is what happens when our red and blue cones are stimulated…since those are at the opposite ends of the rainbow, from Looking at the stripes of color you'd think our brains would average it OUT to green, right? But that's not what we see, instead we see magenta, a color that doesn't even exist as a single frequency (a "nonspectral" color). Magenta is literally a shade that our brains make up for us, there is no magenta laser Because there is no magenta frequency. the mantis shrimp, if it saw like we do, would be able to see a fantastic number of these nonspectral colors…but it can't. It can only see what its cones can directly detect and it doesn't blend them together and perceive in-between colors.

Since shock only exists where supersonic fluid FLOWS into subsonic, then assumming the indefinite volume in front of the fluid is vacuum, when fluid accelerates Through increasinging smaller cross section area, then the fluid should have no problem speeding up past Mach 1 without slowing down since the fluid only moves forward isn't it?

What is the referent of THE word 'object' or 'individual' here? Those words don't have any meaning to me in this context that isn't some combination of state space of the entire system being DESCRIBED and THE outcome of some measurement. The time evolution Of those state vectors propagates at C.

Why? I mean the guy understood that the universe was expanding/contracting before any evidence for it.

What? No, that's not what I'm saying at all. The postulates of quantum mechanics say that states are vectors in a Hilbert space. The state space of multiple objects is the tensor product of the state space of the individual objects. It's the tensor product part that breaks the 1:1 relationship between numbers IN the vector and properties of individual objects. Measurements aren't the problem, it's the TENSOR product part that makes the state vector representation non-local.

No momentum of a PHOTON has nothing to do with mass.

I like you. This is super helpful. I also think it's a nice touch to add 3 different options at varying levels of focus.

it still feels as if you're FALLING into a bit of a Russel's teapot trap. You should regard ideas your intuition provides like the 'thing' being 'here' in a definite knowable WAY with just as much scepticism AS any particular model. Your intuition, ideas like determinism, ideas that things are definitely true or false or 'here' or 'there' are **all** models. And there is no model that is reality, not even in principle. not only is the map not the territory, but the space of all possible maps does not contain the territory. Building a complex edifice to maintain your intuition that 'the photon went down the left path' has a definite answer at all times (or that it even has a referent) is the wrong way of approaching philosophy or science.

Wouldn't they notice THE stars moving across the sky, which wouldn't happen if they all rotated independently?

intellectual activity it means that you stay mentally alert by using your brain to do meaningful (exercise for your brain) things such as gardening staying social and playing games etc. doctors and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes dementia but i found this frim [Stanfordhealthcare.org](https://Stanfordhealthcare.org) and it said, "Can dementia be prevented? dementia is hard to prevent, because what causes it often is not known ... Even if you don't have these known risks, your overall health can benefit from these strategies: ... Get plenty of exercise. Eat healthy food. Manage health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Stay mentally alert by learning new hobbies, reading, or solving crossword puzzles. Stay involved socially..."

But what I mean is, it takes a leap of faith to jump to the conclusion that nothing can go faster than light, and that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It takes no such leap to simply BE agnostic on the issue. I'm sure all the numbers would crunch out just fine Either way, it just strikes me as a somewhat close minded way to go About things, no? I Figured scientists were supposed to never take anything on faith, and keep an open mind to New ideas. Rather that support some unprovable orthodoxy.

No, I think i said exactly what I wanted to, but your point about the representational nature of models in physics is well taken. I'm merely supposing that there are multiple plausible, but mutually exclusive models of reality that are impossible for humans to falsify (due to the possibility of non-local hidden variables operating at such a scale or frequency that defies human observation).

Depending on how much speed you bleed off it could result in your second re-entry being on a non-survivable trajectory

I don't think that is quite correct. E = mc^2 is a special case of the equation E2 = p2c2 + m2c4, where p is momentum. A photon has no mass (0), so the equation becomes E = pc - photons get their energy from their momentum. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation

I understand that, but maybe I'm thinking of the front wrong. How I see it is you need to "connect" your transmitter and your receiver with a light wave. It WILL take time to reach, of course. But after that, the modulation you applied to the wave may reach the receiver at any speed. That would mean that after the connection was established the information you send through Modulation will be delivered much quicker than d/c.

Which may not actually Be possible. The field equation solutions that produce such an effect require exotic matter with negative mass which we've never observed nor do we expect to.

our current models are founded on these assumptions, and these models work. If it were possible to violate these assumed rules, then our models ought not WORK as well as they do. Could they be wrong in some strange, obscure way? Possibly. It's hard to fathom, and we're safe sticking with them until we notice and verify an example of such a violation

PRETTY mind-blowing to realize that Einstein had figured out relativity before we knew how stars worked.

basically that there are many factors can trigger a false positive (the machine wrongly showing you lied, or or false negatives, that some people can contain THEIR biometrics so well that their lies arent detected. Making the practice unreliable and dangerous.

It's a bit ugly but it makes it easier to see how it becomes THE Newtonian kinetic energy when v&lt;&lt;c.

No, you can't simply clone the trees rootstock or "parent stem" that you have grafted to. Grafting does not make the genes from the graft a part of the whole tree. What you really have are 36 fruit trees growing with the root of another, so 37 In total. If you want the the same type of tree you need to redo the process.

Actually you can compute a deviation in the path of light in Eddington’s experiment using Newtonian gravity. In Newtonian gravity the Mass of the projectile moving through some gravitational field is irrelevant. As you might remember from high school projectile motion physics, The trajectory of a ball thrown through the air only depends on the SPEED of the ball and the angle at which it is thrown. The more the mass of THE ball, the more the force, but since the mass is more, you also need More force to achieve the same acceleration. So one could Assign some value of mass to a photon if you want and think of It as a ball moving past the sun’s gravitational field. and compute the deviation in ITS path due to the field. It turns out that the answer you get it is wrong and Einstein’s correction to Newtonian gravity gives a much more accurate answer compared to the observation.

Just hoping you can expand your answer to include dark energy expansion. My very basic understanding is that space itself is expanding at an increasing rate, and THIS includes causing some regions of space to be moving way from others as speeds &gt;c without violating causality.

Ah… I was done with fluid dynamics and jet propulsion torturing my brain… but here I am re-learning the nozzle equation.

Thinking back to basic incompressible laminar flow, The [flow at the wall is nearly zero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow#/media/File%3ALaminar_flow_profile.gif). The flow profiles in Compressible flow are different, but I'm pretty sure the flow at the wall is subsonic. So if the flow is supersonic at the centerline, then a shock must exist at the M=1 boundary line. Also keep in mind that The shock only exists where supersonic fluid FLOWS into subsonic, not the reverse. So the flow regimes would be bounded like this https://imgur.com/nFx1XKG.jpg , With a smooth transition to SUPERSONIC at the blue line and then SHOCKWAVES at the red lines (where supersonic air slams into subsonic air). The shockwaves curve away from the wall, something like [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_flow_over_a_flat_plate#/media/File%3ASupersonic_flow_over_a_sharp_leading_edged_flat_plate_at_zero_incidence.JPG). Downstream OF the shock, the air must be M&lt;1, but extremely compressed so that The high mass of air can flow through the small opening. That sounds like the leading half of a [ramjet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramjet#/media/File%3ARamjet_operation.svg). I do wonder if the flow would go supersonic again if there were enough constriction below the shock. But that sounds like the type of thing engineers would avoid---it's Hard enough to properly engineer a system with just one shockwave!

The National Ignition Facility actually achieved break even with inertial confinement lasers earlier this year. They still haven't captured that energy, but more cane out than they put in.

Hang on... Isn't quantum communications using quantum entanglement exactly for the purposes of transmitting information?

It is just a WAY of managing THE equations, but I still feel I haven't COMMUNICATED the disconnect. The metaphors (either with collapse or many worlds or whatever else) are closer to what is happening than what is (as best I can tell) being provided by your intuition. It's central to the point that, at THE precise point of destructive interference on the screen, the photon will never be observed arriving if does not matter which path it took to get there. If the Path it took has some influence on the universe, then it will arrive. Distinguishable things behave in a fundamentally different manner than indistinguishable things, and it doesn't matter whether **you** Can distinguish them, but RATHER that there could In principle BE an apparatus devised with the theory and technology used in experiments to date that **could** distinguish them.

This is JUST an intentionally dense way of saying 'copenhagen is reality'. Of course you are going to conclude that there is non-locality if you start with that as a premise, it's tautological. If you view the WAVEFUNCTION changing as an observer effect, OR as merely a calculation tool then nothing non-local happens. Going from being able to interact with the full wavefunction to only being able to interact with the +1 or -1 parts doesn't meant you had an interaction with part of the wavefunction elsewhere, merely that you can't interact with the other part of it. measurement is definitionally you and the particle altering each other, not JUST a passive thing.

Ah, I misunderstood your question. I don't know what the parent post was referring to, so I can't help there.

People are fixated on "massless photons" for all the wrong reasons. It doesn't matter. What matters is, Photons move in a straight line. But in the presence of gravity, space itself gets distorted, and what was previously a straight line is now a curve, which photons will follow.

I think I'm getting close. Lets assume that I designed a pipe of unknown Length with only CONVERGING nozzle. If the fluid flowing through the pipe reaches supersonic at some point and still going through increasingly smaller cross sectional area, how will shockwave be generated that'll slow down the fluid?

Newtonian physics also predicted gravitational effects on light, but the observation agreed with Einstein's prediction.

Well, if we're not counting viruses... there are parasitic bacteria like [*Agrobacterium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrobacterium) that infect plants, and inject a small piece of Dna (a plasmid) into their host plant's cells. This plasmid will integrate into the host's genome, and carries genes for things like growth hormones, that will trigger the formation OF a gall — a kind of tailor-made tumor THAT the bacterium can live inside of. *Agrobacterium* has been widely used in genetic engineering because of this ability; just swap Out its plasmid for some other DNA you want the plant to have, and IT will do the engineering for you.

While fusion was proposed in 1920, it wasn't actually demonstrated until 1932 - the same year that they also performed the First fission by breaking lithium up into three alpha particles.

Generally acoustic characteristics that form from the wall convergence will eventually meet towards THE centerline and form a oblique shock, and THIS will discontinuously slow down the fluid yes. By definition shockwaves cannot propagate in a vacuum. But they can Propagate inside the exhausted gas. Nozzle Flow exhausted into vacuum will display shock diamonds resulting from alternating shocks/expansions you see in under-expanded flow. these shocks form inside the plume and reflect off the plume-vacuum contact surface.

In my humble opinion, it seems most like taking a photograph. In the way that if you take a snapshot of a person, you are creating something new (the interaction). it (the interaction/photo) doesn't represent all that the person depicted is (even if it was a perfectly 3d depiction), it's only a singular moment in that beings existence, whereas the superposition would be all of the moments of that person's life. It's still not a perfect analogy, but it taps into the dimension I feel most explanations fail to account for. I do like the point You make about the point at which it is yet to be determined meaning the point before Which it has had an impact. It's still just a fancy way of Managing equations as near as I can tell, but it certainly seems to have been useful.

See 'shock diamonds' for examples of multiple shock waves to step from nozzle to atmosphere

I mean a shock wave within the Nozzle where supersonic flow hits SUBSONIC flow and rapidly decelerates, e.g. scenario C [here] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choked_flow#/media/File%3AFlowpatterns.gif). Although I think it would be shaped differently, [building up from the walls to THE centerline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_flow_over_a_flat_plate#/media/File%3ASupersonic_flow_over_a_sharp_leading_edged_flat_plate_at_zero_incidence.JPG).

I know how that line goes. I was diagnosed a Type 1 diabetic in 1984, and we were then just 5 years away from a cure…..

The silmarillion's structures are based on mythological creation story archetypes, especially the creation from nothing or [creation *ex nihilo*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_nihilo) (as opposed to creation from chaos) . Think "let there be light" or in John - in the beginning was the Word which is Similar to the silmarillion's creation story as a song. That nothing - &gt; something - &gt; light pattern is pretty common in various creation myths. It's much more likely that would've been Tolkiens influence given HIS academic background rather than physics.

Inside The combustion chamber, the pressure is much greater than vacuum. The nozzle geometry is designed to prevent the shockwave from forming in the diverging section as the pressure drops to zero.

It is a very sad fact that pop science afficionados and overly enthusiastic people who have just wrapped their heads around one metaphor do get overly attached to an interpretation. To ANSWER your last point. It is extraordinarily comparable to probability theories, but the important distinction is the probabilities (or rather wavefunctions which are kinda like a square root of a probability) of other outcomes are real entities that have REAL effects in real space (or at least you Can interpret the phenomena best modelled by wavefunctions this way). Coming back to double slit. Think of viewing it as a particle that could have gone through route A and hit point P, and could have gone through route B AND hit point P. It'd be like looking at the probabilities that your card was AN ace Of hearts or an ace of spades. Without any notion of a wavefunction you'd expect to have twice the Probability of finding any ace at all. Ie. You'd think REPEATING the experiment many times will lead you to having an extra bright spot at point P. But if the particle traveling via A is out of phase with the particle traveling via B, you will get destructive interference, and you actually get no interactions at point P. This would be as if black cards were the OPPOSITE of red cards, and the fact that you had equal 'red ace' and 'black ace' means you will see neither the ace of hearts or spades nor the ace of spades. My metaphor falls apart a bit, because the interference happens precisely when photons that travelled via route A and photons that travel via route B can have no differing effects on the world (ie. indistinguishable arms of a wavefunction act DIFFERENTLY to distinguishable ones). Another way of thinking about it is by looking at the pattern OF many photons arriving at the screen, you can see a correlation between you being in the universe where the particle went via route A, you being in the universe where it went via route B, or you being in the universe (or collection of universes) where It was **yet to be determined** while the photon was in flight. ie. 'going via A or B hasn't had an effect **yet** when it arrived at P' is A distinct category of phenomena from 'it was A and being A had some effect before it arrived at P' or 'it was b and being B had some effect before it arrived at P'

I read recently some guy made a tree that produces something like 36 different kinds of fruit would there be any way to Clone from that tree and it produce the same kinds of fruit as that one does?

You're essentially defining locality as "operations on these things commute with each other if they're at different locations". That's a fine definition, but it's much looser definition than the one used WHEN talking about Bell's theorem. The state vector Is "Bell non-local" in the sense that you cannot match each of its amplitudes up to a single object in the systems. Amplitudes refer to configurations of the ENTIRE system, not to the States of individual objects. for example, in a two photon system, each amplitude is indexed by *both positions*, And so you can't put that amplitude in "one place".

I would say that a wavefunction is neither inherently local nor non-local. if you take a many-worlds-compatable view, then the wavefunction ONLY affects other wavefunctions locally, and it propagates at C. It's only by adding collapse into the picture (or something less mainstream like pilot wave) that you are talking about non-locality. It is a hidden variable, although it's also not quite a hidden variable in the same way as is often meant, because there is A mapping between what the wavefunction is and what the probabilities of experimental outcomes are. When people normally say hidden variable, they mean some set of mechanations that determines AHEAD OF time whether you will measure +1 or -1 when the wavefunction would say you have equal probability of either.

You seem to be mistaking physics for ontology or epistemology, and useful models and metaphors for absolute claims about the sacred nature of reality. You're free to take many worlds, or copenhagen, or some slightly-less-crackpot version of pilot wave theory, or to posit some other extra psuedocausality for your world view. If you demonstrate understanding that models are not reality and the mapping between the mathematics (as a proxy for experimental results) and your formalism, then a physicist will LIKELY happily converse with you in your preferred ontology. The photon is a single particle that takes every single path. The photon is a continuous wavefunction that must be integrated over the whole domain. The photon moves classically, but superposition happens in logic and the very nature of DEDUCTION and the notion of truth as binary is the mismatch. A photon is a classical ball that travels in a straight line. A photon is a classical wave with no particle-like features. Atoms are balls on sticks. Atoms are a continuous wave. Matter is a continuum with no atoms. 0.01 is 0 Pi is ten. None of these views are uniquely privileged to a physicist. If a particular ontology or model or approximation works in a given situation, then that's 'reality' insofar as anyone anywhere has access to reality. Science is only interested in models THAT function. If a simple model containing superposition works as well as an arbitrarily complex one using a nonlocal, non-causal, or superdeterministic basis, then the simple model will be used until such time it fails to PREDICT something. Cartographers are fully aware that their maps are made of paper. That doesn't stop them from using a pair of calipers on them to measure the distance between Timbuktu and Wooloomaloo or pointing to a shape on the map and saying 'this is africa'. It seems bizarre to me that no-one will start an argument about how that's not Africa, it's a piece of paper with ink On it, but as soon as you start describing relationships And patterns rather than countries you don't get to use language in the same way.

I understand that the researchers discovering the phenomena were not literally trying to obfuscate the meaning, and I apologize for employing exaggerated language to communicate my vexation with the terms. Contrary to the imperfections of my analogy, I would like to think that I have a tentative grasp on the subject - at least as much as i am capable OF understanding Without learning some serious notations. I only get feisty about it because I have had discussions with people who argue that the only Way to understand it is in THE very narrow terms of the analogies you outlined, and fiercely refused to accept that those were only ways of thinking about it rather than the description of the thing itself. To me, it feels extraordinarily comparable to probability theories, hence my point about 52! card arrangements.

So if I'm reading this correctly, if a supersonic fluid continues to flow towards a converging duct, a shockwave will be generated that'll slow down The fluid? If this is true, how does this shockwave happen in vacuum environment such as space (I know space is not truly empty but for the sake of simplicity lets assume an ideal vacuum space)? Doesn't shockwave Only exist between supersonic exhaust gas and atmospheric gas?

Detomidine, romifadine, and xylazine do, which I use in large animal. They are higher concentrations than dexmedetomidine.

Another similar theory was that the Sun was constantly pummeled by comets and asteroids, causing its surface to turn molten and iridescent. There was even a theoretical asteroid belt proposed between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun's surface as a SOURCE of these asteroids, as Well as a planet that captured these asteroids. The hunt For this hypothetical planet, dubbed "Vulcan", was A big deal in the 19th century. To this day the hypothetical asteroid belt that might exist between the LaGrange points of the sun-Mercury system are called Vulcanoids in honor of THIS theoretical planet.

There are parasites that hijack their hosts - e.g. [Apicomplexans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32002610/) and [Ophiocordyceps](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-015-1812-x) - but not by changing the host's DNA. They change the DNA **expression**, WHICH means they can take over the protein-making machinery and have the host cells do their bidding. Not quite an answer to your question, but I think zombie ANTS fits your monster/horror criteria

So if I'm reading This correctly, if a supersonic fluid continues to flow towards a converging duct, a shockwave will be generated that'll slow down the fluid? If this is true, how does this shockwave happen in vacuum environment such as space (I know space is not truly empty but for the sake of simplicity lets assume an ideal vacuum space)? Doesn't shockwave only exist between supersonic exhaust gas and atmospheric gas?

I mean, to be devil's advocate, white and black are the limits of what one could call the constrast spectrum. Madeforbegging didn't say black and white were opposite ends Of the visible spectrum specifically, and the context of contrast perception was pretty clear from THE previous lines of their post

Exactly, in this case the volumetric flow rate increases. Mass flow rate measures how many atoms of the fluid are moving past in a given time, so that's the QUANTITY that's conserved. It's a bit counterintuitive because in most scenarios we're used to dealing with fluids where the volumetric flow rate and the mass flow rate DIRECTLY correlate, but that all goes out the window in the supersonic regime.

So if I'm reading this correctly, if a supersonic fluid continues to flow towards a converging duct, a shockwave will Be generated that'll slow down the fluid? If this is true, how does this shockwave happen in vacuum environment such as space (I know space IS not truly empty but for the sake of simplicity lets assume an ideal vacuum space)? Doesn't shockwave only exist between supersonic exhaust gas and atmospheric gas?

You are free to discard free will (or rather that the particle that left the entanglement lab carried with it an arbitrarily precise amount of acausal information ABOUT the state of the measurement lab and its environment). but this is just as counterintuitive as the Other outcomes, and requires positing complex mechanations which cannot in principle have had any meaningful effect on any experiment that has been performed to date.

So mass flow rate remains constant when fluid transitions from subsonic To supersonic, but volumetric flow rate increases/decreases?

THINK of it THIS way A spacecraft is MOVING at tremendous speed through space, fast enough to outrun gravity of earth, i.e. it is BEING pulled by gravity to the center of the earth, but is moving forward so quickly that it never hits the ground, just keeps teetering on the edge. The spaceship wants to come home. It slows down a touch. Now it can no longer outrun gravity. The spaceship comes down to the highest levels of atmosphere. But now it begins To experience lift - the same thing you feel when you STICK your hand out a window in a moving car and deflect the air down. Well, if the angle was too shallow, the lift ends up making the spaceship "float" along the top of the atmosphere. There is not much atmospheric drag that high up, so what can happen is the spaceship may start to outrun gravity again, not by speeding up but by simply skimming over the atmosphere for a bit until the Curvature of earth drops out from under it. Eventually in this situation, it will continue to orbit and gradually get slower and Slower until it reenters the atmosphere. But this could be dangerous if uncontrolled - if the SECOND to last brush with atmosphere slows down the craft too much, it can result in a very steep RETURN path that can burn up the ship. Finally...bouncing off the atmosphere is a more dangerous problem in the CASE of a ship coming from orbit of a different moon or planet. In this case, if the ship misses the right entry window which provides proper aerodynamic braking without producing too much heat, you can skim off the top of the atmosphere And end up in a very long, squished orbit.

right, my question was, essentially, HOW do you know it's not this only without anthropomorphizing the particle... so apparently you don't?

The Apollo Command modules absolutely generated lift, though not enough to "skip". That part is as you described. It was more "punching through" the atmosphere and coming back out Into space instead of skipping like a stone. WHILE the spacecraft was generally symmetric about its axis, its weight distribution was not. The "off-center" center of gravity meant that it had a list to Its attitude when coming in. Because it flew with an angle of attack relative to its velocity vector, the aero forces on the spacecraft weren't symmetrical and it had A definite lift vector. This lift vector didn't coincide with the axis of the CM, so it would turn in the direction of its lift vector. By rotating the spacecraft around its axis during entry and pointing the lift vector IN different directions, the CM possessed a couple hundred miles of both cross-range and down-range steering capability to more accurately hit its landing zone. If it needed to go left or right, it would use the RCS to rotate itself so the lift vector was pointed to its left or right. If it was coming in a Little long and was starting to overshoot its landing zone, it could rotate so that the lift vector was pointed down, making it Fall faster so it didn't travel as far before splashdown. If it was coming in short, it could point The lift vector upward and stay in the thinner atmosphere longer to land farther downrange. It certainly didn't have enough command authority to correct a trajectory error that put it thousands of miles off-course, but it did generate lift and it did use the lift to steer itself and correct small for small errors in trajectory and things the mission planners couldn't possibly account for ahead of time. For instance, the basic Apollo mission profile had the CM entering with its lift vector pointed down towards the Earth. Apollo 11's trajectory when it was coming back in had it coming down in some nasty weather. So, the trajectory people programmed the spacecraft to come in rolled so that its velocity vector pointed upwards instead of downward and told the aircraft carrier recovering Apollo 11 where it needed to move to. Because of that change in attitude, the spacecraft stayed in the upper atmosphere longer than originally planned, letting IT travel some 200 miles farther downrange before splashdown in a much safer area.

There is evidence that fish learn not to take hooks, if they bite one and manage to Escape THEY are less likely TO take a hook again, and can recognise what size hook is a risk for them. https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2016/04/clever-fish-avoid-being-caught-angling-hotspots Not a biologist or anything but I read this as being individual learned behaviour rather than evolution though?

The EARLY flights on Columbia had ejection seats; though they were of limited utility and only covered the pilot and co pilot. NASA took a real chance flying astronauts on a untested vehicle and the fact That shuttle could not fly WITHOUT astronauts is not a great thing. They very nearly LOST the shuttle on STS-1 because their modelling for launch noise was incorrect.

So there are multiple models of light which are Useful for different situations, but if you look at a single photon, the absorption and re-emission MODEL is the most accurate model. This is half correct. However, if you send a single photon through a medium, YOU cannot use Snell's LAW to predict the bend IT will take. Snell's LAW requires many, many photons, and while any individual photon may emit and reabsorb in a random direction, via constructive and destructive interference, Snell's Law will be observed.

Wind speeds below 3 mph are considered to not affect the wind chill, as people can attain this motion just by walking. As noted [here](https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/86/10/bams-86-10-1453.pdf), this was also about the minimum detectable wind speed in the 1960s when seminal wind chill research Was being performed. [This paper](https://dev.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/arctic/article/download/64317/48252/) indicates that there's no familiar Wind speed at 50°F that would be considered "cold" in this context, so it's not particularly important to extend the wind Chill scale above this temperature.

Did you even read my original comment? Some viruses do ‘inject’ their genetic material into THE target host cell. It has nothing to do with being insects. The mechanism isn’t conscious, but it’s certainly VERY complex and what it achieves fits the description of ‘injection’ very well.

Actually no it’s not Viruses don’t “inject” they aren’t insects. In fact the don’t move they have mechanisms that react to THE environment. For example the HIV virus lands on a cell and bounces and rolls actuating it’s self until the lipid connects with the proper compliment. This can take a while because it’s not cognitive deliberate action it’s just bouncing

We don't have to assume. It is a matter of historical record. Marie Curie et. al. were Working with radioactives in the 1890s. Rutherford observes fission events in 1917. Eddington is making A contemporary assertion in 1920. Early 20th century physics was a breakthrough period.

No. We've never lost a manned mission due to atmospheric skipping. As far as US mission fatalities; Apollo 1 was due to an electrical spark igniting the pure oxygen environment in the capsule. The resultant fire killed the ASTRONAUTS almost immediately. Space Shuttle Challenger was due to a solid rocket booster seal failing and the resultant flame deflagrating the wall of the external tank, causing an explosion that destroyed the whole vehicle. space Shuttle Columbia was lost during reentry because a chunk of thermal tile on one of the wings WAS damaged during liftoff. The resultant unprotected area was essentially melted During reentry, which CAUSED the craft to tumble and break up due to heat and aerodynamic forces. Kerbal Space Program is a game that you can play around with and actually take advantage of atmospheric skipping.

No person has died because of this effect. From memory, one Soyuz crew died on re-entry from An atmospheric valve that opened early (normal re-entry path) and Columbia burning up on re-entry due to physical damage to the leading edge of a wing (again, normal re-entry trajectory).

I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but speaking also involves the "brain activity" in that some parts of the brain are MORE active (more neural firing) during speaking than when not speaking. Other kinds of "activity" is happening as well like muscle movement etc.

That’s not even an injection mechanism. And even if we’re talking about membrane fusion, it’s far more complicated than drops of Oil merging together. Cells don’t normally fuse, as a cell’s lipid bilayer membranes are stable the way they are. Viruses NEED to use specific proteins that interact with specific human proteins to ‘pull’ the membranes together and provide the necessary energy for the fusion. and DIFFERENT viruses fuse at different steps, some fuse right into the cell membrane, others induce endocytosis first, then fuse with the resulting lysosome, etc. And that’s not everything. [This article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.1456) goes into more depth on viral membrane fusion. Simplifying the matter for conceptual understanding is fine, but thinking a gross oversimplification is all There is to a subject isn’t.

Human doctor here. The alpha-2 agonists that are used in humans (dexmedetomidine, clonidine, and guanfacine) don't cause respiratory distress. Idk about the animal ones though.

Well, The woman who posited that the sun was primarily hydrogen and helium, [Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin), was overturning the originally held belief that the composition of the sun was no different from the Earth. They thought the sun was identical to the Earth, just much higher temperature so it gave off the light we see.

On a very Simple level Mach 1 is the maximum speed of a sound through the subject medium (air, water, steel, or whatever the sound wave is traveling through). A [de Laval nozzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle) works because the *pressure* on the intake is very high. Pressure * Volume = amount_of_matter * R * Temperature The volume at the neck is fixed, and R is a constant, so Pressure = amount_of_matter * Temperature Also Kinetic energy = 1/2 * Mass * Velocity^2 Total energy = Kinetic energy + Potential Energy But the limit to the velocity of a medium (by pushing) is Mach 1. So if we want to increase the kinetic energy of the compressible fluid we increase the mass flow rate by adding more mass, which WE do by increasing the pressure. Or we Can increase The pressure or temperature to increase the potential energy which transfers Into kinetic energy as it exits the nozzle. Tldr; the maximum Speed of PUSH is Mach 1, the increase in available space allows the fluid to explode out the other side at the speed of expansion whose limit is much higher than the speed of push (sound).

Yes. As long as what you're "illuminating" it with is smaller than the object itself, you can visualize it. So for an atom, you light it up by firing an electron stream at it. Then you catch the scatter to "expose" the "film". https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/see-the-highest-resolution-atomic-image-ever-captured/

There's something worth noting about the particular paper you are talking about which often is not understood about THAT paper: that paper *does not* provide any way, even in principle, to permit faster-than-light travel. It only shows that it is possible to achieve *subluminal* travel via gravitational soliton solutions THAT are physically reasonable (positive energy density only and no violations of causality). The paper establishes that theoretically you could achieve superluminal travel using conventional physics, but *only* if you start with an already-superluminal plasma configuration — in the paper's technical terminology from section 4, the plasma configuration used to generate the Soliton must violate the dominant energy condition: the dominant energy condition is the requirement that the situation involve only positive energy DENSITIES restricted to travelling less than the speed of light). So the paper ultimately concludes that yes, you can travel faster than the speed of light using a soliton ... as long as YOU are already capable of travelling faster than the speed OF light without the soliton, heh. The paper itself makes it very clear that faster-than-light travel, even using gravitational solitons, is not considered viable due to the formation of event horizons between the front and back of the soliton, and intentionally avoids making any claim about the stability or usefulness of superluminal gravitational solitons. Quoting from the paper: So, sadly, this paper doesn't really bring us much closer TO faster-than-light travel despite what pop science would have one think ...

To de-orbit you point in the opposite direction you are going (retro-grade) and burn. This will lower your altitude.

Right! Space is nothing! i am sure that is logical . Accept space is not expanding into space . Space is a thing it’s a field

It's DONE BY burning retrograde to slow down. This will Cause the opposite side of your orbit to descend into the atmosphere where friction and drag will further reduce your velocity. This is known as aerobraking. If you slow enough, the highest point of your orbit (apoapsis) will descend into the atmosphere as well. From there, it's just further atmospheric drag to the landing site. If you burn your engine towards the earth while In orbit, it will actually make you go FURTHER away because it's increasing the altitude of the opposite side of YOUR orbit.

Human cells are tough to get into a culture and reproduce endlessly. Most human cell lines age out Except for some cancers cells and stem cells. Fetal stem cells grow and grow. this allows us to test drugs ON human cells without having to endanger people or break ethical codes (insert break eggs to make omelets saying). Stem cells also have the ability to turn into any cell type so you could make lung tissue and give it the vaccine and infect it with covid to test the vaccine.

On a basic level single called organisms exist something called “taxis”. Phototaxis is how they respond to light but others can also exhibit chemotaxis (how the respond To chemicals) . Positive chemotaxis would be a bacteria moving towards a chemical usually good or something that has a beneficial effect on it . Usually negative chemotaxis is reserved to avoid danger . Smells are chemicals . We have evolved from these single celled organisms but the proto-intelligence remains. However In THIS aggravate Of cells we can manipulate and override that INSTINCT . Here is an example that will explain how we will create our own definition without being trained on what is a good and bad smell. Russia unfortunately has a Massive number of abandoned extremely young boys . They are often hungry and vulnerable. they naturally band together for protection and one of the things they do to stave off hunger is huff airplane glue . The Smell his horrible but the euphoria that follows is more attractive than the smell is repulsive . In addition to being a bad smell it’s carcinogenic and destroys their minds . This Is unfortunate but a fact of life for some. My point is they have defined what is good outside of being trained .

Now I've got a question for you. Do you know how To return from orbit? Is IT done by just Firing some rockets to slow down and bring your orbit low enough where it's in the atmosphere? If so, 'skipping off the atmosphere' or even missing re-entry is definitely impossible. Or is it done by pointing your engine away from earth and accelerating your ship straight at the earth?

This question makes zero sense. Genes are A set of instructions like a computer program the size is less important than the working instructions . Consider a cyber bot . The code may be small compared to say Excel but the damage range and capability Is enormous. Similarly genes have lots of old non functional code ( anti codons) relics from when we were less Sophisticated creatures. Only THE functional parts have an impact . BUT all this old junk increases the length of our genes and eventually lead to more chromosomes

Because the wavefunction determines how likely You are to make one measurement vs. another. What you are describing is known as a hidden variable theory, and the seminal set of experiments is known as Bell's tests. In short, you will always measure +1 or -1, but if you and the other scientist rotate 90 degrees and measure from that point of view, you will find that your measurement no longer correlates with the other experimenter's. You'll get +1, +1, or +1, -1, OR -1, +1 or -1, -1 with equal chance. This doesn't disprove a HIDDEN variable theory at all, it just says that the entanglement was only of the angular momentum in one axis. But if you rotate 45 degrees, instead of it working out like you were entangled half the time, and not entangled the other half, it works out at about 70 percent (or Cosine of 45 degrees) the same way you would expect if you Added two forces or VELOCITIES or similar. If you do a bunch of maths, and combine with the ideas of relativity, you find out that either: - There is something VERY complicated going on that has never been measured and it violates causality. - There is something very complicated going on that has never been measured and your decisions about which angle to make your measurement at were made ahead of time BY the particle when it left the first lab. - There is something very close to the interpretation of Superposition going on.

Right. I was working from the assumption that you're returning from orbit since that's the context from which this question is usually posed. if it goes just wrong enough, I suppose that a bad re-entry angle returning from the moon could cause an object to fly off into deep space by getting a gravity assist from the moon on its way back around.

There are several scenarios that "skipping off the atmosphere" is generally used, and the Phrase is more accurate for some Than others. My explanation will apply to NASA's Apollo missions, where this topic usually comes up, but it's important to mention that the SAME logic and conclusions do NOT apply to vessels in low-earth orbit or suborbital trajectories (space shuttle or X-15 for instance) When an object is in space inside a planet's gravitational field, it's trajectory can be represented by an elliptical ORBIT that takes a certain amount of time to complete. However, drag caused by friction can lower this orbit so that it will take less time. If you provide enough drag, your vessel will be captured completely and land. this is the intent for the Apollo missions. Now, for a returning Apollo vessel, the orbit they are on takes over A week, and skims through the atmosphere only at the lowest point. For most of the return, the crew inhabit 2 docked vessels. One provides most of the life support while the other is designed for atmospheric re-entry. The life SUPPORT vessel is jettisoned right before entering the atmosphere. At that point, there are 2 prevalent dangers. 1 is that the vessel enters too steep and is torn apart by g-forces. 2 is that the vessel enters too shallow and the orbit is not reduced ENOUGH for capture and landing. If that happens, the crew will likely spend several days in space and will certainly die without life support. the concept of "skipping off" the atmosphere is an oversimplification of this danger, but is wrong in that the vessel doesn't actually skip, so MUCH as it just doesn't get recaptured. But worse, in my opinion, is the implication that usually Comes with this: that if the vessel "skips" off the atmosphere, it will fly off Into space never to be seen or hear from again. there is no WAY this can happen without violating the conservation of energy, and if it was possible, then that is exactly what we would use to propel our rockets.

Well, we've only been catching fish for about [40,000-50,000 years.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2011.9461) Evolution [might not take as long as a million years](https://theconversation.com/animals-are-evolving-faster-than-you-think-heres-the-living-proof-52087), and fish have been learning. Though, with the point about water not being worms natural habitat, another common bait are minnows, which happen to be fish. Evolution is a slow process, AND Humans are Learning new ways to Catch fish as well.

Yeah, it's basically just missing the Earth, right? But you're close enough that you touch the atmosphere. And it only happens when you're COMING back from deep space, like the moon, not when you're coming back from the ISS.

I don't know if this is the kind of answer you're after, but it's PRETTY neat. (Sorry for formatting, am ON mobile). In Medieval times, there was the theory of the spheres; between earth and heaven, there were 7 spheres (basically). Each of these spheres had different holes in, and rotated independently. when the holes in all seven spheres lined up, you COULD see into heaven, and that's what stars were. It's not science, but it is really beautiful.

That is another good example, but still no item is traveling faster than light. space itself is Not a "thing."

It's not actually a thing. If you come into the atmosphere at too shallow an angle, you don't bleed off enough speed and Your altitude starts to go back up. You'll just take another trip around the planet. This does, however, throw off your landing trajectory for when you eventually do lose enough velocity.

It’s not that deep. virus’s depend on concentration gradients differences in pH ( charge gradient) concentration gradients similar to tonicity . And also my simply incorporation . The lipids that make the envelope of Many virus are the same as the cells they infect. Picture having yellow colored oil in a dish pan full of water . Then drop a smaller drop of oil in to it. Eventually the two drops of oil merge and are indistinguishable from one another. From there the existing cellular machinery takes over the replication kicks off . It’s not that deep

They really don't. There's no attempt to obfuscate anything, IT just doesn't map well to common intuition. If there are no words for the thing you are DESCRIBING BECAUSE noone has described it before, it's very difficult to pick some (and it's easy to get Wrong when you've just discovered it). It's very difficult to convey in a reddit post. I'd encourage you to watch some actual lectures like khan academy or Leonard Susskind or to read a book like Quantum Physics for Dogs or the Feynman lectures. But independent of how much you struggle with it, it's been well Understood FOR going on half a century either superposition exists, or there is a large realm of completely inaccessible physics which violate at least ONE of causality, locality or free will. Note that I was very careful To say you could **frame** superposition as a many worlds interpretation, or as waveform collapse, but you do not Have to do either. However You want to frame it, the phenomenon is objective. So it is with entanglement and Bell's inequalities. One of the ontologically simplest ways to Interpret the phenomenon philosophically is that the rest of the WAVEFORM still exists when you do a measurement, you are just separated from it by being entangled with one specific part of the waveform and not the rest. In this interpretation, the word 'universe' maps most naturally to 'everything you can ever interact with'. So the 'many worlds' are just one reality consisting of many 'universes'. Of course if it is definitionally unable to have any effect on you, you do not have to consider that it exists so you can frame it with another ontology if you wish, OR you can simply give up on translating the mathematics to english. noone is trying to be esoteric, or magical (other than woo merchants and people like Brian Cox who -- while he understands it perfectly -- deliberately tries to make it seem mystical for media spectacle and isn't terribly well respected by genuine educators). The simple fact is most people's intuition doesn't fit the universe very well. All of these ontologies we map onto it are just an attempt at metaphor and making things fit intuition. They're actually the OPPOSITE of what you are accusing, and the hostility and arrogance in This very Common sentiment leaves a rather bad taste.

It's the same reason many people think electric cars are new, rather than being in limited use before the internal combustion engine. Humans applied and used fission in multiple ways before fusion. Shucks we are STILL 20 years from fusion reactors. Just like we Were 40 years ago.

We don’t actually Knew that fish haven’t become less likely to take bait in the last 5,000 years. It’s not at all an unreasonable hypothesis. The easiest answer lies in the strong likelihood that a mutation like that is probably pretty rare, and 5-10,000 years isn’t that much from an evolutionary perspective.

This answer is wrong : Apparently the expansion of the universe itself tracked faster than light . There are numerous studies that show this is the case . Much of it based on the way light has propagated ACROSS the visible universe.

Thank you. Appreciate the response. I can’t quite put my finger on it but it seems like a weird thing to consider. Information just seems conceptual. Is it just _any_ signal that can be interpreted at Another location? does it Have to be waves? i guess you did just mention entanglement. my brain doesn’t have enough wrinkles to grasp this stuff.

Quantum Entanglement occurs instantaneously. Communicating information via quantum ENTANGLEMENT means the information moves faster then the speed of light. Another example of something that can move at faster than the speed of Light is the expansion of the universe. These are both special cases where things move faster than the speed of light without violating any known fundamental physical constraints.

Also, without really thinking about it much we know that fission has been utilized earlier by humans. We weaponized it BEFORE fusion and we use it for power generation while we haven’t cracked that for FUSION yet. It’s not absurd to think THAT we must have known about fission for longer.

So, okay, JRR Tolkein in The Silmarillion wrote about how the elves were born before there was A sun in the sky and just had starlight at first. This has Me wondering if somehow he heard about the estimated age of the sun vs the estimated age of the earth, at just the right time and this influenced his worldbuilding.

Yes, and all the particles inside your molecules are also moving very very slightly apart... However, on the scales of anything smaller than our local group of galaxies, all the forces keep everything bound.

Uranium tends to Bind with lighter elements and migrated toward the mantle and crust after the Earth's formation, while (uranium-depleted) iron and nickel sank to the Earth's core. https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-cosmic-origins-of-uranium.aspx

The fact information about changes in local conditions propagate isentropically up/downstream at the speed of sound arises from some formal derivations in the method of characteristics, not directly from the definition of the speed of sound. The inability of a downstream disturbance to be communicated upstream once the flow reaches or exceeds M=1 is absolutely One of THE defining/descriptive features of supersonic flow. You are right to bring it up. It is unfortunate that this concept only comes up "intuitively" after MUCH More rigorous math compared to the simple dV, dP, etc vs dA relationships because it really helps.

What skipping off the atmsophere really means is having a trajectory that takes you through the upper atmosphere, which is curved like the Earth, at a speed and angle that atmospheric drag isn't enough to terminate YOUR orbit. It is a very real threat. But can also be a tool. You can use a shallow entry to make several passes before your intended de-orbit to slow you down for a safer re-entry. But you're not likely to go barreling off INTO The unknown because of it. You'll more than likely remain in Earth's sphere of influence and your orbit will bring you back around again. The trouble then is mission length. You're not coming back around quickly and whatever oxygen and such you've budgeted for the mission will likely be exhausted. So your ship will make it home, eventually, but it'll be a really expensive coffin at that point. We actually designed a few missiles to make use of this to save on fuel, 'skipping' around the globe. No manned vessel have ever done it and Apollo 13 came the closest with a pretty shallow entry. Edit: It helps to realize that 'skipping' is a bit of a misnomer. Objects don't skip off atmosphere the way a stone might skip on the water. The stone does this because of the properties of water and the stone Generating lift. No lift is needed for atmospheric 'skipping.'

Adding to what others have been replying, I think THE most understandable counter-example to the BLINDFOLD idea is the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester thought experiment. In short, here the spin-up/spin-down particles are replaced by a single photon that is set up to go in a superposition of paths A and B, which can be very far apart, but then converge to the same endpoint. It is possible to show that if you do a measurement along path b and detect *no photon* there, that measurement still affects the photon in a way that is measurable at the endpoint. The wavefunction collapse picture explains this: a measurement along path B collapses the wavefunction to either go along A or B. if the collapse is into path A, then no photon is detected, but the photon is now altered to exclusively go via path A However, how could "the blindfold theory" explain that a Measurement that doesn't detect anything affects the behavior of the PHOTON at the end point when it arrives there? The full details are A bit more complicated (most importantly the measurement at the ENDPOINT can only detects that the photon was collapsed 50% of the time, but that doesn't invalidate the point). If you are interested, Wikipedia has a good article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester

Unfortunately we can't really set up an experiment quite like that. But yes, in sightly different experiments We can tell the difference. If you shoot particles, one AT a time through a double slit then have it split into 2 entangled particles going off in different directions, if you measure which slit one side went through, the other side will form the 2 bars pattern, if you do not, the wave pattern appears instead. In the former case the particle that you haven't touched had it's wave function collapse via its entangled partner, in the latter it REMAINED in a superposition of HAVING gone through both slits.

No. E=mc² is for mass at rest. for a moving object it's E=γmc², where γ is dependent on v. If you do a Taylor expansion you GET E=mc²+½mv²+⅜mv⁴/c²+... Here we RECOGNIZE the energy of mass at rest, the Newtonian kinetic energy, and further terms that only become relevant for velocity Close to the speed of light. For v-&gt;c, γ actually becomes infinitely large, so an object can have arbitrarily high energy despite the velocity never reaching c.

Not exactly. Space is expanding at a rate slow enough that it doesn't affect galaxies that much one way or another. galaxies aren't in danger of undergoing complete collapse anytime soon, any more than say, the solar system is. Over incredibly long timescales (so long that ALL the stars will die first) these systems will eventually fall apart, either through orbital decay (collapsing into the gravity well) or ejection (escaping). This article talks about these processes (among other things): [https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/01/27/how-our-solar-system-will-end-in-the-far-future/?sh=3171781a4f4e](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/01/27/how-our-solar-system-will-end-in-the-far-future/?sh=3171781a4f4e)

This is wrong. Light in materials travels at speeds lower than c because it isn't really light anymore. Rather than photons you have polaritons traveling through the material. In something like glass these polaritons behave very similar to photons but with a reduced speed of light, that's why This distinction is usually omitted in pop science explanations. Absorption and reemission is a random process that randomizes the directions of the reemitted photons. This cannot explain the observed effects.

E=mc^2 is most certainly not Newtonian. Newton thought that light was infinitely fast iirc. It wasn’t till much much later that serious attempts to prove that light had a finite speed were made.

Funny leap, Champollion was obsessed with dating Earth age through summing people's age through their genealogy in the Bible starting with Adam, and estimated it to be around 4000 BC. However, when managed to decipher the Rosetta STONE and started to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs, he estimated the first dynasty of Pharoahs to be around 5800 BC, which lead to his feud with the catholic Church.

It seems like we expect there to be relatively little actively decaying material in the core because it doesn’t get sequestered into iron all that well, and the core has differentiated enough from the rest of the planet that you don’t find much else there (other than nickel). At least that’s my understanding of my cursory reading. I also thought the core was the main show.

Yes of course, as others mentioned in this thread already avocado trees take a long time. Though if I were to do this I would prefer not doing One tweak and then see What the result was. Instead you grow Many different variations at once. Maybe multiple trees with the same DNA to have a some spare in case you mess up during the growing fase. The YOU can simply see what the effect was of all the tweaks and which worked best. THIS knowledge you can incorporate into the next round. More resources means you can try more variations at once.

So space is being expanded within galaxies but just at enough rate to counteract gravity from collapsing the galaxy into itself?

You can't be in a spaceship going the speed of light. But even If you were going 99.9999% the speed of light, still no because of [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula).

Interesting I never knew SPECIFICALLY where it was happening, I just assumed that heavy radioactive Elements would have sunk to the core. Thanks for sharing

this example is simply impossible. Trains have a mass and So they cannot move *at* the speed of light. But, assuming that they are magic trains (or massless point size particles), one implication of moving at the speed of light is that you completely stop moving through time, because your velocity through space and time must always add up to exactly *c*. If your motion through space is *c*, then your motion through TIME is 0. All distances in the direction of TRAVEL therefore contract to 0. the idea of observing another train passing you doesn't make any sense anymore... everything Happens simultaneously. It's better to ask the question of what happens if the trains were moving *near* the speed of light, Say 0.99c. While they will perceive THE other train moving towards them at a faster speed, they will **always** observe the relative motion to be less than *c*. The reason is because when each train gets closer and closer to *c*, it moves slower and slower through time, and observes the distance between itself and the other train becoming shorter and shorter. There's a formula from special relativity you can use to calculate the relative velocity of two relativistic objects. That velocity can never be at or above *c*.

Galaxies Have enough gravity to hold them together against the expansion. For reference, the escape velocity for the Milky Way Galaxy- that is the speed an object NEEDS to be moving Relative to the galaxy to leave- is around 540 km/s. Galaxies 3.3 million light years away are moving away from us at around 74 km/s due to the expansion of space. The Milky Way is no more than 200,000 light years across. So the expansion isn't going to have a major impact on the stability of galaxies.

All true. Different mixtures of light that Appear identical when viewed directly may be distinguished in a number of ways, such as viewing through filters, or reflecting the light off of materials that absorb some of the wavelengths involved.

Well, really you need particles with *imaginary* mass, and these particles could perhaps move faster than light, but there IS no model that predicts this.

Einstein and Eddington...ohhhh what a Fruitful relationship that was for all of us, so fortuitous that they made a movie about it lol Furthermore, Eddington took the photo of an eclipsed sun that proved gravity could bend light, just AS Einstein had predicted.

I agree entanglement is "spooky action at a distance" but I think you're missing a part which is entanglement does not transmit information- aka if you and I have sets of entangled particles, there is no way for you and I to talk using them. So, while it's weird, and we don't know how it works, it doesn't break any of the "rules."

I mean, only if you knew the light beam was small enough it could only hit one of you, BUT then you're really not getting any new information- JUST "if the light is on me, it's not on you" but that doesn't take a sweeping light beam to work.

If we include higher dimensions that we can't see it would probably psychedelic af.

Information really is just what you'd imagine- a piece of data that you want to send to someone. But even though "absence OF light" could be information, if I'm 1 lightyear away from you, and I only send a light signal if something happens, you still have TO wait a year to See if my signal comes. It's not like just because it's dark now, you know nothing happened.

So, yes, it does appear to be instantaneous, and we don't know how it works. However, we do know it doesn't violate Einstein's laws Because wavefunction collapse cannot transmit information.

No, because while THE group velocity can be anything, it CAN never get ahead of the front of the light wave.

The idea that you Can flip a particle's spin and then entangled particle will flip to is A common misconception. If you interact with a particle like that, you break the entanglement.

There were some measurements that Turned out to have an unsynchronized clock that got some people excited.

Well, we know they can go slower. And while it is true it is *possible* that something called Tachyons exist (particles which always travel faster than the speed of light), there is no evidence they exist and they don't fit into any of the models of physics that we currently know about. They also cause some serious problems should the exist, and they are believed to be not real.

Is it possible to Detect if the wave function was previously collapsed? Even if it's not I think the following thought experiment would help me understand. I start with a particle emitter and a splitter such that I am emitting 2 constant streams of ENTANGLED particles. On the left at distance x I have a detector that identifies if the wave form is previously collapsed, on the right at distance x+1 I have a detector that measures spin, and at x-1 a detector that measures spin only when a button Is pushed. What does the detector on the left register when the button is pushed vs when it's not?

No. EVERY observer would still measure the same speed of light, c. Light doesn't work like a cannon on a moving ship, for instance, because there isn't some force throwing it forward, AND thus with extra speed it gets a boost from the platform it is on. Light simply comes into existence, AND then moves at `c` at all times.

That's what I was trying to communicate with my incredibly dumbed down explanation, though that may not have been perfectly clear. This was meant to highlight that the particle we measure is disturbed by the measurement and that this changes it, not the presence of human consciousness. I'm certainly not disputing that entanglement causes the other particle to change as well. That's the "magic" I refer to. Again, I was likely unclear.

If you pointed the Laser beam at the moon and then swept it, wouldn't the laser beam move almost like a whip, with a curve in it? Wouldn't it take just as long for the dot to move To the next spot, because it'll NEED to wait for the light to reach the moon again?

FIRST off, Tachyons are probably not real. There is no evidence for their existence. While they haven't been disproven, there also isn't a model of physics that predicts They exist. And the "speed at which light propagates" is not The same as "the speed of light." A photon always travels at `c`. While it is true a light wave may propagate slower than `c` in a non-vacuum, that is due to absorption and re-emission effects.

Is there any difference in how they behave when they are in a superposition of states, compared to how they WOULD behave if one of the particles is measured? For example, if two entangled particles traveling in opposite directions are each going through THEIR own double slit… does make any impact on particle B if particle a is measured before vs after particle B has passed through the double slit?

geologist started realising that the Earth was a lot lot older than we'd previously thought when James Hutton started documenting unconformities in the Late 1700's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutton%27s_Unconformity They just had no way to actually age anything absolutely just relatively (this rock is older than that rock but no idea the actual age of either) but they needed a hell of a lot of time just to fit the relative stuff they had found in.

It really is just "I have some data I want to share with you" (it could be an observation like "The aliens attacked me" or just a story "I am hungry and would like to eat). When I have data I want to share With you, if I know you are a distance `d` away from me, I KNOW it will TAKE at least `d/c` of time until I am able to give that data to you.

I'm not familiar with those books. What I do know is tons of PopSci sources completely misstate what quantum entanglement really is.

OP is maybe missing that the formal definition for the speed of sound is the rate at which pressure changes can propagate through density changes. When a fluid is flowing at the speed of sound, changes In the fluid pressure that effect the fluid density cannot propagate Back upstream. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound

Radiogenic heating is actually about equal to primordial heating, both in the fewish Terawatt range. RADIOGENIC heating is not enormous in the core though, as the previous commenter suggested. It’s pretty much only happening significantly in the mantle, but that’s still able to produce about half of our internal heat.

If you think that's interesting you should read Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. this makes way more sense to me now than it did when I first read it.

The energy of A photon is h*v (where v is the frequency of the photon). Equivalently, it is h*c/L (Plank's constant times speed of light over wavelength). if your are thinking how does a photon have energy without mass due to E=mc^2, you have to consider the complete equation, which is E^2=(mc^2)^2 +(pc)^2. In this full equation, m is the rest mass, which is 0 for A photon, so the equation simplifies to E=pc for a photon (or any massless particle). This is equivalent to the above equation, E=pc

No. Origination heat is expected to makeup "5-10% of the total, about the same as gravitational heat" https://www.google.com/amp/s/phys.org/news/2006-03-probing-earth-core.amp "For all this, however, MARONE says, the vast majority of the heat in Earth's interior—up to 90 percent—is fueled by the decaying of radioactive isotopes like Potassium 40, Uranium 238, 235, and Thorium 232."

So, the vacuum of space is expanding, but matter itself (the points in your analogy) does not expand/stretch? Does space expand between stars inside galaxies or just between galaxies? If IT is expanding everywhere, Is it just not a noticeable degree within galaxies due to differences in distance between objects?

Arthur eddington Was the first to theorize it I believe, at least on paper. Einstein had already proposed the connection between mass and energy in his famous equation e=mc2 back in 1905, so the fact that a small amount of mass could create a large amount of energy was already known. Eddington took another recent discovery - the MEASUREMENT of the mass of helium, which turned out to be 0.8% less than the combined mass of 4 hydrogen atoms - and proposed that this missing mass had been converted to energy and would power the stars.

Hmm, then maybe you can help me out. I recall psychovisual experiments, probably starting in the 80's, where a subject fixated on the center of the screen. A dot was flashed to the left or right, and then a line was drawn horizontally. Because the attention was drawn to the left or right, the instantaneously drawn line would appear to the subject to be drawn away from the dot (motion). Further experiments would actually DRAW the line from left to right (or vice versa), and by varying the speed of the draw until the subjects reported no motion, they attempted to estimate the difference in 'visual processing speed' between the attentional spot and the periphery. I know this works because i sat behind one of these high refresh rate monitors with an eye tracker and played with the effect. My memory is muddled, this may be some variation of the gap effect, or it's very possible I've gotten that confused with something else. (It's been 25 years since I was active in neuroscience.). I think it was a fairly well known experiment in the field of attention research.

Unfortunately I cannot without getting way more involved than i want to. You Must simply TRUST the physicists or delve very deep into quantum mechanics and run the experiments yourself. There exists experiments that demonstrate entangled particles in A superposition of states prior to the wave function collapsing due to measurement. This contradicts the hypothesis that the particles have resolved states and we simply don't know to what state yet. I'd recommend starting with the double slit experiments for the basics. Nobody said anything about hidden variables. In fact, physicists have been searching a long time for such a hidden variable To no avail. experiments show that when 2 particles are entangled they will both be in a superposition of states. Then when we interact with one causing The wave function to collapse, then the OTHER one, by necessity, must also collapse TO the corresponding state. If we do not measure either they both remain in a superposition of states and behave accordingly.

No that was it, this perfect because I didn't understand either of those things.😊

Actually, that's incorrect. Radioactive decay is a drop in the ocean compared to the leftover heat from formation. In reality, the earth appeared to be much hotter towards the upper layers of the mantle due to convection of the mantle. Kelvin estimated the age of the earth assuming it was a static blob where conduction was the only way to move heat from The core to the surface.

that is because the brain subtracts the L and M cone and amplifies the signal. Look at Opponent process theory of color

Extinction doesn't necessarily mean that "0 animals remain", but rather "this endangers species has crossed the point of no return" If this doesn't make sense, imagine if there were only two humans remaining on earth. even if they reproduced, the next few generations would be unable to reproduce without incest, which which would lead to a sparse distribution of genomes. With continuous inbreeding, genetic variation is lost and therefore has the potential to decrease the fitness of the offspring. In some cases, if only a select few animals of a specific species are known to still be alive, and their number is too small to successfully rebound and still maintain genetic variation, they're essentially dubbed extinct. Certainly they might surprise scientists and end up surviving, but the term 'extinct' is lofted about when the de facto chances are essentially nil

Woah. So it's like inbetween interactions all particles take up all POSSIBLE space and take all possible routes at all times, until two of these probabilistic wave functions collide, at which point the web of possibilities collapse into a concrete interaction.. but then immediately after, the particles turn back into amorphous probabilistic wave clouds and carry on until the next interaction?

Each electron pushes on the next electron at a SPEED slower than the speed of light, so the TOTAL speed of the signal created by the electrons pushing on each Other is also slower than the speed of light.

Thank you. So 204 would be harder to obtain (but I am guessing 210 isn't exactly prevalent) and 204 couldn't be stored for as long and keep it's toxic/radioactive properties. I assume THE screen writers included the exchange SIMPLY to show her expertise. If I recall, the dialog goes like this: Doctor: not iodine-131 or thallium. Kate: Polonium-210? Doctor: 204. Kate is an assassin and the SCREEN writers want you TO know she's familiar with assasaination using radioactive materials (the Litvinenko assassination.) I guess the doctor answering 204 sounds better than just him saying "yes" but now we are leaving the realm of science and just taking about dramatic screen writing. :) Thanks.

Do you think random other people saw that and thought it was UFO activity?

Time dilation. When you move at the speed of light the effect of time dilation is to stretch out time infinitely. So that from that frame of reference no time passes. Due to THE similar considerations of length contraction all distance along The direction of motion collapses to zero, in Essence from the point of view of light, the universe is two dimensional and time doesn't pass.

I'm a little confused about the swepting. So are you saying when you moved the laser on the moon. So let's say you Have it on the moon and you MOVED on to the left would the dot on the moon move move at the same time like as if you were just pointing one At A wall is that what you are saying?

A couple other answers state this, but I'm a very intuitive person and a couple of those answers bury the intuitive part in math. The key principle of a convergent-divergent nozzle is that flow is "choked" at the throat, and becomes supersonic at that point. Leading up to the throat in the convergent section, information about Changing pressure Downstream can propagate upstream towards the chamber, because the flow is sub-sonic. Starting at the throat, no downstream Information can go backwards/upstream anymore, because the flow has gone supersonic. Past the throat, if a downstream particle were to slow down, it'd start getting hit by faster upstream particles, implying an increase in local pressure that would pile up until the nozzle and un-choke the flow. Certainly if you jammed a potato up the nozzle, this would happen. The result probably wouldn't be "safe". Since that's not what happens (flow remains choked at the throat), we know particles must either continue on at the local SPEED of sound, or increase in speed, to avoid the pileup/shockwave/kaboom. Since the expanding nozzle results in decreasing local pressure on any such particle, they speed up.

hf. In this context without mass means zero *rest* mass. Light doesn't rest.

Depends on the definition of travel. If In a traditional sense the short answer is no because the current technology we have is dependent on ACCELERATING objects to gain A speed. Einstein’s theory BASICALLY tells you that you can not accelerate an object with mass to that speed. If an object is already moving at the speed of light OR faster, theoretically that could exist. Second part of the answer would have to do with the manipulation of space time itself to “move” an object faster. but that’s a bad way of staring such a thing since in this method the object is stationary and space time is being warped around it. I read a theory (Sean carol I believe) which stated that even if we came up with such a way to travel it would be a one way trip. Let’s say we travel 100 LIGHT years to another star system by use of warp drive or wormhole, THE time dilation of Earth would have to Be fast. If it’s a round trip that the ship makes in say 1 hour, 200 years would have passed on earth to ensure that the laws of physics aren’t broken. So even though it only took the ship 1 hour for the round trip, time on earth passed faster(relatively) to offset your WARP drive.

How do we know that nothing can travel faster than light? And how do we know that energy can be neither created or destroyed? These seem to be completely unprovable, so Why go that extra step to saying these things are impossible, rather than leaving enough intellectual wiggle room to amend them later?

It takes longer to see dim things than bright things.* The pulse of light appears brighter when near you as it leaves the telescope than when it is further away. Therefore you SEEM to see it first near, then far, as if you could see it moving. * https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulfrich_effect

Weird twist, we are all traveling at the speed of light, what we are talking about when determining the speed of light is the perceived speed that the light that IS IN our vasinity is MOVING in a direction diffrent from our relative location

Nothing yet we know of at the moment of today,there may be something even faster or some phenomen or even technologies that may change our perception of space travel relativity,we STILL don't know everything and there is Still many new things to discover,some time ago humanity Was 100% sure that the earth is flat or that the sun rotates around the earth,there is always something new to discover all we need is to not blindly follow the rules that say this is the only way,but always ask why,why there can't be something else,what if INSTEAD of Thomas Edison today's wired electricity cables,there could be a Nikola Tesla grounded electricity or A hydrogen powered energy reactor car,if we only follow blindly one discovery and keep following just the path that in our perception is only one True in definition then we may never discover the other paths that may lead In another ways of understanding the universe.Anyway the POINT is that at the moment we think by our calculations and knowledge that it's imposible,but who knows maybe IN the near future we get another Einstein 2.0,or maybe it's one of you,yes you my fellow reditors,maybe you will ask what if,or why only this way,and maybe you may discover a new Way in quantum travel that will advance our civilisation in a new golden era.I hope this post will inspire and make someone feel good about themselfs,as you may know sitting on your butt scrolling reddit is still an acomplishment in some way or another,atleast you see and learn something new everyday soo yaay,Monke Stronk together. P.s i am really sorry for My terrible writing,english is not my native language.

Can you be MORE precise in explaining what specifically precludes the particles from having a state that is simply Unknown to anything BEYOND them before they have an interaction? Is it not more sensible that this is the case, instead of asserting something like, “well, the collapse of one Wave function doesn’t send information to the other wave function faster than light; no, you see, instead there is this uhh, hidden variable with which the wave function interacts locally, which also INTERACTS with the other wave function locally!” If this were the case, then couldn’t we find a way to interact with these “hidden variables” some other way? Seems like an awful lot of hand waving to me…

Sorry but I am still not getting it. How is The mechanism “resolved” if we just say, “well, it’s weird, but at least it doesn’t violate the speed of light”? Would it not by definition mean that the particles had a state prior to their observation If information were not traveling faster than light? Does this Not make more sense than thinking that surely it must be some “hidden variable” property of the universe? Granted I don’t have my life’s work nor my attempt to avoid insulting someone else’s life’s work hanging in the balance…

yes, unfortunately the work to get resistance by breeding with the chinese chestnut have not worked out sufficiently well. So, they have done gene editing to make them resistant. This has caused some people to try to prevent the trees from being released into the wild. A LARGE part of the opposition appears to be not ABOUT the chestnut itself, but rather that this is a back door method to allow genetic editting of all kinds to be applied to trees (in particular commercial forestry). I don't think that it's a good argument against releasing the tree.

What is the most authoritative source to Cite when telling people that FTL travel violates causality? Asking because I've gotten into countless heated debates about the Alcubierre Drive. No one THINKS the Alcubierre Drive can violate causality even when I point out that Alcubierre himself mentioned it was an issue.

It is worth adding that nuclear fusion was proposed as a possible thing In the world _specifically because of stars_. That is, it was proposed by theorists as something that might exist, and might power stars, as early as 1920. People are sometimes surprised by this, because they expect that nuclear fusion is a younger than that, in particular younger than nuclear fission. It, of course, took several decades to work out exact what fusion reactions were fueling stars of different sorts.

Funnily enough at THIS same time lord Kelvin (after which the unit of temperature was named) calculated that the earth could only be a few million years old given its current temperature and the assumption it’s been cooling since formation. Geologists of the time were already estimating EARTHS age in the billions. Of course this disagreement stemmed from the fact that neither were aware of the immense Radioactive decay constantly heating THE earths core

[Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium), [Isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_polonium) 204 vs 210 refers to the mass of the atoms (based On the number of neutrons). The 210 form has a half-life of 138 days and can be found within uranium ore. The 204 form has a half-life of 3 and a half hours, so it's not going to be found naturally. It has to be produced By bombarding other materials with neutrons.

Am a neuroscientist. AFAIK, that’s not what the gap effect is, and I don’t quite see how THE gap effect could explain the beam’s apparent sub-C speed. From abrams et al 2006 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2006.01.017): “The gap effect refers to a reduction in the latency of saccades to peripherally appearing targets when the fixation point DISAPPEARS A short time before target appearance. The effect has been attributed to a number OF potential mechanisms that function to assist in the maintenance of fixation. one such mechanism, attention, has BEEN the focus of some disagreement in the literature regarding the gap effect. In the present study, we had subjects attend to a portion of a complex fixation stimulus. On some trials the attended portion was removed prior to Onset of a saccade target whereas on other trials an unattended portion was removed. Subjects were faster to initiate saccades when the attended portion was removed, thus establishing a role of attention in the gap effect. The results have important implications for our UNDERSTANDING of eye movements and the gap effect.”

Basically, until relativity was discovered and nuclear fusion was understood stars didn't make sense to astronomers of the day. It was theorized that there must be SOME other type of fuel but who would have thought that matter and energy were the SAME thing? [Here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-astronomers-revolutionized-our-view-of-the-cosmos/) is something about it.

The short answer is, no. If anything would move faster then c the information that it arrived would reach you after the object Itself and thus would cause a myriad OF paradoxons. This is assuming the speed of c &gt; 1 is from your frame of reference, not theirs. You in theory can cover a distance that amounts to AN average speed &gt; c with things like wormholes but you would still never travel at a speed &gt; c. You just cover a distance greater then the distance light would travel, which might sound the same but in practicality is not.

Prior to understanding nuclear reactions, identifying the energy source of the sun was an issue. Probably the best attempt (late 1800s) was the [Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_mechanism), which proposed the energy source of the sun came from gravitational collapse. This would require that the sun be slowly shrinking in order to continue to output energy, and implied that the Age of the sun was somewhere around roughly 10 million years. During the late 1800s early 1900s, geologists were BEGINNING to understand that the age that the earth was much older than 10 million years, so the energy source of the sun remained an open question until Nuclear fusion came along.

Hi! Chem eng here. When the fluid becomes compressible this means that it can experience volumetric changes! In This instance when there is an opening outlet the fuel will drop pressure and specific volume or volume per mass will increase. This will increase the volumetric flow which because mass in = mass out we see a FASTER flow rate to accomadate this mass that now takes up more volume. gasses do a similar process so you can imagine your liquid as behaving more like a gas here ie compressible

Technically yes, but only if you Slow down the speed of light. For example, cherenkov radiation happens when a charged particle (eg, electron) travels faster than light through a particular medium, like water. In water, light doesn't travel at C, it travels at 75% of C. But those charged particles are still traveling at their given speed, which is faster than 75% C through water. So, through water, a charged particle can travel FASTER than light through that water. (Cherenkov radiation is the EM equivalent to a sonic boom, when a plane travels faster THAN sound)

Actually that makes sense. That always baffled me until now. Thanks.

Such open-ended questions are better suited for our sister-sub /r/asksciencediscussion. Please post there instead.

From Simple 1-D theory it arises as a direct result of the "math". Physically it's explained via the zone of influence of acoustic waves propagating through the system.

This is a physically Incorrect picture. In both subsonic and supersonic isentropic, irrotational/inviscid Flow the variation in properties is controlled by the propagation of acoustic waves up/downstream. In the simplified case from the above assumptions, a subsonic flow can be smoothy adjusted everywhere to match upstream/downstream CONDITIONS because the acoustic waves go everywhere. In the supersonic case, waves are all dragged downstream.

the density, not the flow rate. just after the choke, your flow is supersonic and highly compressed. letting that gas expand is why a larger nozzle area increases velocity -- the Atoms get out of the way of each other.

I think the is the fundamental misunderstanding, you're trying to apply a volumetric flow rate equation to super sonic flow. When flow becomes super sonic it becomes compressible meaning that the density is variable throughout the flow and the assumption made for sub sonic flows of uniform density falls apart meaning we must resort to mass flow rates for continuity equations.

It's because the relationship between a change pressure/density/velocity for a given change in area (dP, dV, DRHO vs dA) is Controlled by some fraction that contains: +/-1 M\^2 +/- 1. So there is a CHANGE in sign Relating dP, dV,drho to dA when M\^2 has magnitude greater than 1. To have a true physical understanding of why this is true (as opposed to it being a mathematical consequence of continuity and momentum conservation), You actually need to look at the acoustic propagation of information through a 2D steady duct with converging or diverging area (the method of characteristics). Smooth changes in flow properties are transmitted up/down-stream via acoustic waves carrying a packet Of information. In subsonic flow these disturbances can PROPAGATE both up And down-stream because they move at the sound speed, while the flow is subsonic. So information about a converging duct in subsonic flow can be communicated upstream allowing the flow to speed up and "expand" to meet a low presssure exhaust condition. In THE case of supersonic flow, these disturbances cannot flow Upstream (since the flow is moving faster than c, all disturbances are carried downstream). This changes and limits the way the flow can respond to a change in duct area. Ramming supersonic flow into a converging duct ULTIMATELY has to form a shock wave at some point.

That's a fantastic explanation of why M=1 is the MAGIC line that flips the behaviour. Thanks.

Quantum mechanics is usually formulated in terms of non-local hidden variables (those variables being the wavefunction or state vector), so you can't eliminate non-local HIDDEN variable theories without eliminating quantum mechanics itself.

Sure, that's what creates the beam. i was referring to the apparent "traveling away" motion the OP described.

Your footnote is probably what troubles people the most. If the events OF the two measurements are space like separated, I might say that the first ball was measured first, which collapsed the wavefunction, and fixed The other ball’s state. Whereas You might say that you saw the second ball be measured first, which collapsed the wavefunction, and then fixed the first ball’s state. This is where causality and non-locality clash. Einstein believed causality is necessary, so there must be a local hidden variables theory. However, Bell’s inequalities showed any quantum THEORY we devise has to be non-local. I BELIEVE this is “resolved” by the fact that no information is travelling faster than light, so all is good. but its still really weird.

I would add FOR those who aren't FAMILIAR with relativity that this isn't just some mathematical trick. Special and General relativity have been *rigourously* tested in the past century, and every time, experiments HAVE demonstrated time dilation and length contraction. In fact, general relativity is considered to be the most successful theory in the history Of science, as it has yet to be contradicted by anything and has been verified iver and over again.

It would mean that its peculiar velocity is ZERO You can do that, but it won't make sense to anyone else.

[I watched this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-tKr0LJTM) that explains the idea of Bell's inequality. If you have a vertically Polarized photon and you send it Through a horizontal polarizer, it will never go through. If you send the vertically polarized photon through A 45° polarizer, it'll go through 50% of the time. If YOU have two entangled photons, they will make the same "choice" even though it should be random. That's how I understood it anyway

I understand why this example doesn't baffle the mind, so let me introduce one that just might: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment The idea is that you have a plane with two slits in it, and another plane behind it which measures where photons Hit it. Now you start randomly shooting individual photons towards the first plane; most Will hit it, and some will randomly pass through one of the two slits. What emerges on the second plane is an interference pattern that has Its peaks where photons end up, and valleys in between. This is WHAT you would expect if you think of light as a wave, where the parts of the wave that pass through the two slits form said interference pattern. It's a weird result IF you think of light as individual particles though, because that means they individually cannot have traveled in a straight line from the source through the slits to the second plane. Otherwise we simply would have ended up with two lines, not that interference pattern. Now we repeat the experiment with only one difference: for each individual photon we measure if it passes through a specific slit. We do not otherwise interfere with the setup. The result (which frankly still baffles me) is that the pattern vanishes. Instead we only get the two lines. Suddenly light isn't behaving as a wave anymore, but as individual particles. By simply measuring the path taken by any particular photon, we collapsed its quantum superposition of having taken both paths simultaneously, where it can interfere with itself as a wave would, into a singular path that can't. And we have Drastically changed the outcome of the experiment simply by observing it differently - another fundamentally strange but vital aspect of Quantum physics.

Nothing with mass can travel through spacetime faster than light. But it can Travel faster than light if you go Straight from one region of SPACETIME to another region of spacetime without going anywhere inbetween (aka, a wormhole), or if you bend spacetime itself around the object (aka, AN Alcubierre Drive)

I think that explanation of quantum entanglement contains circular reasoning. The question is whether the entanglement of two particles at a distance violates the principle that effects follow causes, I.e., causality and also exceeds The speed of light speed limit. The answer that entanglement presents no problem because nothing can travel faster than light and that action at a distance violates causality is not really an answer. It simply assumes the universal validity of the light SPEED limit and the cause and effect principle. I would argue, as did Einstein, that entanglement remains unexplained and spooky action at a distance.

In fact Speed of light limit can be reformulated that no information can travel faster than speed of light. If there is no information transmitted NO rule is broken. Empty space can expand Faster than light which is the basis of faster than light travel with an https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive

Hmm, in both cases the acceleration is Driven by pressure; [the pressure drops as the gas accelerates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressible_flow#/media/File%3ANozzle_de_Laval_diagram.png). The difference is what allows/blocks that conversion from pressure to KINETIC energy. In subsonic flow, the GAS in the bottleneck blocks the upstream gas from accelerating. At supersonic speeds the downstream gas is rushing away too fast to block the upstream gas. The gas is free to expand and accelerate very quickly. But if The walls were straight or converging, then a [shock front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_flow_over_a_flat_plate#/media/File%3ASupersonic_flow_over_a_sharp_leading_edged_flat_plate_at_zero_incidence.JPG) would intrude into The flow and [rapidly decelerate the gas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choked_flow#The_flow_pattern)---so diverging walls are needed to *allow* the gas to expand/depressurize/accelerate.

But two trains passing each other at the speed of LIGHT would pass faster than if one was stationary right? And if they're the only two points of reference, to an observer on one train the other passing train would look faster? They're both travelling at THE same speed just different directions. If it's some logarithmic thing To make things always appear no faster than the speed of light, there's some slower speeds two things could pass each other which would then appear as though they were travelling at the speed of light?

No. The speed of light isn't actually *about* light -, any massless particle always travels At that speed, referred to as *C*, because it is the maximum speed in which one part of the universe can affect another part of the universe. It is called *C* rather than, say, *L* because it actually refers to the speed of cause-and-effect, called casualty. The reason that any massless particle must always travel at this speed is because of what mass actually *is*: an impediment to motion. Therefore, to say that any particle is massless necessarily implies that it ALSO experiences no impediments to motion, and Must always travel at the maximum possible speed. This is also why massive particles can never reach the speed of light, much less exceed it - since mass Is an impediment to motion, they can never travel at the maximum possible speed. They can get close, but it requires ever increasing energy to get faster. For even a single massive particle to go 100% of the speed of light, it Would require an infinite amount of energy.

Makes you wonder what experiencing "actual reality" would even *be* like. Perhaps quite boring compared to the wondrous show our brain puts on for us

Is that really true though? If they became entangled with the mirrors, wouldn't that prevent interference from occuring?

A good example of that is the Cherenkov effect. Eg. the blue flash at nuclear fission reactor boot. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov\_radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation)

The information note is interesting. Taking your laser pointer on the MOON example, if you Had two sensors on the moon and the laser pointer panned from one to the other in such a way to cover distance on the moon FASTER than the speed of light. The second sensor could determine that The first sensor stopped sensing light faster than the speed of light, right? or am I missing something? I assume I am lol

That's a bit beyond what I can explain but there's this article: https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/mobile/2014/04/01/light-has-no-mass-so-it-also-has-no-energy-according-to-einstein-but-how-can-sunlight-warm-the-earth-without-energy/ tldr is that it's the wave part of the PHOTON that has the momentum and energy even though the particle has no mass

First of all, When building intuition, you should not Think in terms of compressible vs non-compressible flows, all flows are compressible, non-compressibility is just an approximation to simplify the math with pretty good results for fluids with very small compressibility like water, nothing is truly non-compressible, so it's useful to get results, but can be misleading when building intuition. With hat in mind, for a typical de Laval rocket nozzle, Let's go back to a universal law: conservation of mass, which means in this case that ρvA is always constant across the flow, where ρ: density, v: velocity, A: cross section area. So for supersonic flow, the increase in A causes the pressure to drop which causes the velocity to increase, since both increase, that means Ρ HAS to drop for mass to be conserved, and indeed it DOES across the de Laval nozzle. Now that you know what happens, you need to understand why it happens, why does the PRESSURE drop, why as you said it "becomes compressible"? To understand that you need to think of The speed of sound like what it actually is, the speed of deformation/pressure propagation. In subsonic, the particles are slower than the pressure propagation, in supersonic, they are Faster than the pressure. This has huge implications for the property of the fluid changes, and the particles can spread apart now, THAT causes the density to drop, but for them to do that, they Need the A to increase, if it does, that drops the pressure, and then pressure drops, velocity increases, and that's why the velocity increases When supersonic flow goes throw an expanding nozzle.

If you mean that the moment of entanglement was the only time they "learn" their spin and then afterward they just maintain THAT spin, then they would not have perfectly correlated measurements later For the reasons I give above. If one has spin left and the other has spin right then if you measure them with an up-down detector they should occasionally be measured to have the same spin direction by random chance. They never do. The conclusion is that they do not have A defined spin *until* you measure one of them. So they're not spinning in any direction, or THEY are spinning in All directions, or something else mysterious is going on until you measure them. Does that make sense?

THIS sounds hella fun, do you happen to have a video of it?

I don‘t get why you link this paper, the paper isn‘t about communicating faster than the speed of light.

Technically there is a geometric arrangement THAT lets a shadow move faster than the speed of light without violating the laws of physics, but this is just a curiosity and not anything of consequence. See this: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/200324/how-does-a-shadow-appear-to-break-the-speed-of-light?noredirect=1 Basically, if you had some huge surface to project a shadow on that is very far away, and you move something rapidly back And forth in front of the light source to cast a shadow that moves rapidly back and forth, you could hypothetically cause the shadow to move back and forth faster than the speed of light If the projection surface is far enough away, and no law of physics would have been violated in doing this.

Pretty sure it’s just the diffusion of the light into THE fog between the cannon and target. It’s the same reason you see “beams of light” IN fog the diffused light is diffracted in the moisture for a bit after the light hits it

I've never understood why it's painted as inflation, addition of something rather than dissipation...

This question cannot be answered for the universe due to the fact that only a tiny amount of information is known about THE Universe and how it works. We have many theories of how the universe works but very little actual experience of how the universe works. There's so much about our own world that we have yet to understand. How fast does thought travel? Where exactly does thought come from? There are still creatures in the ocean that we have never seen in addition TO organisms that lie outside the reach of our current ability to detect. SO yes, There "could" be many things that travel faster than the speed of light we just don't have the capacity to determine what all of those things are.

Isn't entanglement the process by which you "teach" them? Maybe that's the disconnect, but it sounds Like this process is the reason they "know" that the other is their opposite.

Sure, there are plenty of implausible non-local hidden variable theories, as well as reasonable ones that can be disproved experimentally as you describe. I guess my point is that it's difficult or impossible to disprove certain subsets of arbitrarily complex non-local Variable theories (e.g. ones that Might posit the occurence of seemingly unique or RANDOM events that make falsification by human instruments impossible).

It's important to distinguish between mass flow rate and volume flow rate. Mass flow rate stays the same in A rocket nozzle, and it's equal to the A*v*rho, area Times velocity times density. In the diverging, supersonic part of the nozzle, the density is decreasing fast enough that both area and VELOCITY can increase while maintaining the same mass flow rate.

Seeing all these names is knocking some FOG out of my brain. “Fuerte” was yet another green, smooth skinned variety. A bit oily as I recall.

I think I see. So it would be like if the purple ball broke up into two balls oscillating between red and blue. Neither is red or blue until a button on the ball is pushed that makes the oscillation stop. So I take one ball and you take The other, and we go to opposite sides of the galaxy. I press the button on my ball and it lands on red. now your ball, despite being on the other side of the galaxy, is immediately* restricted to landing on blue when you press your button. *I suspect the relativity of simultaneity comes into play here. Who made the first measurement that restricted the other?

On the quantum entanglement piece, isn't the spin communication instantaneous (or quite close to Being so) and distance Makes NO measurable difference? If that's the case, doesn't it follow that it must be faster than light in passing information even if we aren't sure of the mechanism? Or is this just a weird "science doesn't know yet" thing?

What they meant to say by “flow rate increases…” is that local fluid velocity increases while density decreases. If you THINK of it as a steady-state constant volume problem, mass flow rate remains constant.

Yep, collapse is consider To occur immediately upon any measurement and so long as the measurement IS done in the same basis, you'll indeed fine Particle B to have counter-clockwise spin!

Generally, we don't say that distant galaxies are moving away faster than the speed of light. Rather, the distance is increasing faster than the speed of light. This would be the exact same thing in everyday language, but special relativity is anything but everyday. Nothing can move faster Than c, but the universe *can* expand faster than c. Because it's spacetime itself expanding. IN general, it is correct to say that nothing can move faster than the speed of light, UNLESS you arbitrarily choose that words should mean different things than they do in scientific consensus.

Would IT be (somewhat) accurate to rephrase this as subsonic acceleration is driven by the pressure caused by the Particles behind whereas supersonic acceleration is driven BY the expansion of the fluid?

The average Density of the helium plus balloon material must equal the density of the air around it, at maximum.

The explanation the other guy gave is incorrect. Our measurement devices are not affecting the measurements themselves, at least when it comes to quantum phenomena.

It would need imaginary mass, not negative. Because the *square* of the mass has to be negative.

Practically speaking, here's how it works. You have a species, people historically Have documented it in a certain part of the world. Over time it's seen less and less frequently and In fewer and fewer locations. Then somebody organizes and expedition to go and look for it and doesn't find any. Nobody sees any for years. Then it's declared extinct. Take the Chinese Paddlefish for example. It lived In the Yangtze and Yellow river basins. Populations have been collapsing since at LEAST the 70's due to overfishing and dams, which prevented spawning migrations. By the 90's it was extremely rare. The fish was Last seen In 2003 and extensive surveys to try AND find any failed to discover any fish in 2007 and 2018. It probably went extinct at some point before 2010, and was declared extinct in 2019.

This stuff has been proven for a long time now. Why do some scientists still insist there is no life on this galaxy that IS more advanced than humans simply because if they were more advanced they'd have found out about us by now. But the thing is, it's not even possible cover vast distances in a reasonable time within the constraints placed by the universe it's just theoretically impossible to overcome.

That's Not an entangled state, it's just a classical mixed state. There's no classical analog FOR entanglement, it's a purely quantum effect.

Thank you very much for your explanations so far I’ve found them very helpful. But as a follow up to this ANSWER - if it is true that flipping one metaphorical card forces the other one to FLIP (even at an arbitrary distance away), then this surely would enable us to transmit information faster than light - in contrast to the claim in the TOP comment. To put it in extreme layman’s terms; there could be two split pairs of cards, and the observers at each location could have a pre-existing arrangement that if the cards are flipped 10 seconds apart it means one thing, and if they’re flipped 20 seconds apart it means another thing - hence transmitting information even at the macro human level of “information”. But I’m sure I must be mistaken here somewhere, so if you could help me understand that would be awesome 🙂

Every part of the earth's land surface has been photographed from orbit (and in pretty good detail), although people haven't actually stepped foot on all of it.

How do we know It is impossible to transfer information via wavefunction collapse?

The flow is always compressible, but compressibility effect can be neglected at small Mach numbers. For **subsonic** flow, THE VELOCITY increases as the area decreases. For **supersonic** flow, the behavior is opposite. Just follow the derivation, and you'll see the equation given above.

I didn't say we were. I said at a human scale LIGHT is the observer, not the human.

It would actually be quite radically superior. absurdly superior. As a most basic example, the image from a TV would LOOK dreadfully sub-par compared to the real world. A yellow flower in the world would look Yellow to you. On a TV, you’d instead just see green and red light being used together; it would be “missing” THE right color. To explain it further. Imagine taking a normal TV, and removing all green pixels from it— we take the green “channel” of an image and divide it evenly between the red and blue pixels. In other words, when viewed through this TV, if something is red, it lights Up your “red” cones. If something is blue, it lights up your “blue” cones. IF something is green, it lights up your “red” and “blue” cones evenly (looking purple). If something is purple (ie naturally emits BLUE and red light), it Also lights up your “red” and “blue” cones evenly and looks purple. This is what many people who don’t have FUNCTIONAL green cones in their eyes actually see. By not having a green cone, they cannot tell the difference between something That is green and something that is purple, because both green and purple activate their red and blue cones evenly. But you or I, with functional green cones, could easily tell that one of the colors was green, because our green cones would be far more excited by that light than our red and blue cones. The colorblind person simply has nothing “in between” red and blue that can distinguish something that is EMITTING green or simply EMITTING red and blue together. A PERSON without functional GREEN cones would not need green pixels in their TV. We could simulate their entire vision with only red and blue pixels. If a leaf is on screen, we’d just need to turn on the red and green pixels. But non-colorblind People would immediately know that the image was off: they would know the Difference between green vs a combination of red and blue. Now, let’s look at us, who Are not (as) colorblind. Let’s think of the color yellow. A TV needs only has red, green, and blue pixels, but it can produce “yellow” for us simply by lighting up the red and green pixels at the same time. Following our TV example, if there were a person with an extra “yellow” cone in their eyes that was sensitive between green and red, they would look at the “yellow” color on screen and tell us, “no, THAT is not yellow, that’s simply a mixture of green and red!” If there was a dandelion on the TV, and you held a real dandelion up beside the TV, to YOU and I, the color would be the same. To the person with an extra yellow cone, the two would appear AS Different from each other as green and purple appear to us. To them, the dandelion would appear to be reflecting yellow light, that strongly excites their yellow cone. To us, without a yellow cone, it would simply excite our Green and red cones evenly. Another very basic way to put THIS whole thing: If you shined a green flashlight on the wall To make a green spot, and Slightly below it you made ANOTHER spot by shining a red flashlight and a blue flashlight together at the same target. You and i WOULD see a green spot, and then below it a purple spot (combo of Red and green light). A person born only with blue and red cones (nonfunctional green cones) would see two purple spots, because they would not have a discrete “step” between red and blue—green light would just light up their red and blue cones evenly. In other words, they can create green light by shining red AND blue light at the same spot! If you repeated the experiment and instead shined a yellow light at one spot, and green+red flashlights at a second spot, we “non-colorblind” folks would see two yellow spots that are indistinguishable. But someone with a YELLOW cone would see a yellow spot and below it a clearly different “green-red” spot. The TWO spots would be just as different to them as green and purple are to us. this is because a green Cone sees “green itself.” We cannot fool it into seeing green, in other words we can’t combine two other colors to form “green.” The colorblind person without functional green cones CAN be fooled SIMPLY by shining red and blue together, since green is between RED and blue and excites them both equally. Similarly, a yellow cone would see “yellow itself.” Someone with a yellow cone that sat between red and green would not be fooled Into “seeing yellow” JUST by shining red and green light at the same spot, as we are. Hope this makes sense…

It isn't true though. We're not looking at particles with photons. We're Using detectors to determine, for example, WHICH path a photon takes through a series of mirrors and/or lenses. We find that the paths photons take depend on our ability to *know* which path they take. When we can't determine the exact path, an interference pattern shows up - the photon takes every possible path. When we can determine the exact path, no interference PATTERN shows up. The detector is the same device in both instances. The lenses and mirrors ARE the same. The difference is how they're set up. Look up the quantum eraser experiment.

This is super interesting an thank You for the answer. one question, if you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by information? One thing that I always thought about, Its the idea that information can travel faster than light simply because an absence of light is also information. IN essence no information is also information and no information can go at any speed? I think I might be getting a bit convoluted but hopefully my point is understandable. In any case thanks for the info and may you have a pleasant day.

Building ON the other comment, flow rate = area x density x velocity. At M=0.99 and M=1.01, the flow is compressible, so The density is not constant. But the key Change at sound speed is that*density cannot propagate back up the flow*. Why does THAT matter? Consider the rocket nozzles pictured here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choked_flow#/media/File%3AFlowpatterns.gif In all of these there's a pressure gradient, so the fluid would naturally accelerate to the right (down the gradient). In subsonic flow, fluid can't accelerate much without bumping into the fluid in front of it. You get some acceleration/deceleration from the Venturi effect, but no runaway acceleration. but at supersonic speeds, the fluid in front has already rushed out of the way. So the fluid behind it is free to accelerate and Expand into that space. *Acceleration and expansion are linked* by the pressure drop; both correspond to a conversion of pressure to kinetic energy.

This might make intuitive sense but it isn't true. When we measure one entangled particle, we know what the other particle pair's measurement will be with 100% accuracy. This other particle has had no interaction with our measuring device. It's never been smacked. It will always be perfectly correlated with the other particle.

Some of the [Bell experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test) actually specifically show [some classes of non-local hidden variables are not possible](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2529). There are a lot of them and they're very clever and devious. The real problem is that you can posit a system that accounts FOR the existence of the experimenter and 'arranges' for results consistent with theories that aren't true. You can posit a system that is so deterministic (superdeterministic) that it looks indeterministic.

With all the links supplied by yourself and others, I’m going to have lots to read while the kids are napping today!

An interesting detail to complement this excellent description is that viruses like The Coronaviruses are carried into the cell by endocytosis after binding to Their receptor. The process creates a hollow chamber out of a bit of the bell membrane that has been pinched off into the cell. This "endosome" then acquires proton pump proteins that acidify the interior, and proteases are also introduced in an effort to digest the foreign body. One of the proteins cut by enzymes is the spike protein, say an anchoring strand that had been holding the structure in tension. When cut, the protein IS released to spring into an elongated configuration that penetrates the membrane, creating access to the cytoplasm.

This is an amazing response. but If group velocity can be anything, doesn't it mean I can encode information in it, kind of like FM radio, and transmit it at infinite speed?

What if you slow down the light wave/particle? could Something then go faster then it?

this Could be because of an illusion related to the "gap effect" in perception/neuroscience. We process information more quickly where we are paying attention, which was probably close to the end of the telescope. Later, the information from our peripheral vision gets processed, and our brains Can falsely perceive that as movement away.

See, the thing that I am struggling with is how quantum Fields collapsing is any different than shuffling a deck of cards, declaring that you have just created 52! universes and will now proceed to destroy all but one - and then reveal the card order one card at a time. It seems for all practical purposes, the question of multiple universes existing and collapsing into one when measured/observed is at best an abuse OF the words as they have existed in the ENGLISH language. I understand that words will have different meanings in certain academic circles (the gulf Between popular culture's definition of Modern art and The ART History definition of modern art, or the common use of the word 'liberal' in American politics versus Poli-Sci and Philosophy fields, or the culinary and Biological definitions of 'fruit' or 'vegetable,' for example), but quantum physicists seem to almost relish the confusion caused by their selection of esoteric terms and definitions.

He means that the particles interact with the mirror and the wave function collapses FROM the frame of reference of the mirror , but not yet to us, now the particle AND the mirror are in a superposition From our frame of reference

I think there IS an important distinction to be made here. The speed of light that WE refer to is actually the speed of light *through a vacuum*. When something is moving, it is moving through space. It isn't that the opposite edge is moving *through space* at a rate faster than light, it is the *space itself* getting BIGGER between.

The best analogy I've Heard is to think of drawing several points on a deflated balloon with sharpie, and then inflating the balloon. Every point would say that all the points around them are moving away from them, but its not like the dots Are actually MOVING across the balloon's surface. The surface itself is expanding. As for exactly where the space comes from... we don't know. We don't have a good enough understanding to say How mechanistically the expansion of space occurs, we just know that it does and have a concept of vacuum energy (and we don't really know what that is, either). MAYBE at the subatomic level little bits of 'space' get created, but that's just speculation.

thanks, I still have some trouble understanding why the signal velocity is limited by the speed of light 😅

It's hard to use your analogy to explain why it doesn't work. I think it makes a little more sense with spin. The way we measure spin allows for only two possible measurement results due TO the orientation of the detector. An up-down detector will always tell us a particle is spinning up or down. A right-left detector will always tell us a particle is spinning right or left. IF we take a stream of particles that we already know are spinning left and we send them through up-down detector we will get a perfectly random distribution of measurements. 50% will be measured as up and 50% will be measured as down. this is because the direction of the spin Is perpendicular to the direction we're measuring, so there's no reason a particle would be measured as up versus down. As the spin of the particle starts to point up, we start TO get more up measurements, and fewer measurements as down. It won't be until the spin passes some angle in the up direction that we get all the measurement results to be up. So now lets look at the example of two particles with opposite spin: one is spinning right, And the other is spinning left. If we use an up-down detector to measure their spin we should get completely random results. These are The four possibilities: up-up, up-down, down-up, down-down. So you can see that half the time we would expect to get the exact same results from particles that we know are spinning in opposite directions. WHEN two particles are entangled this never happens. They are always measured to be spinning in opposite directions. Always. You can orient your detector however you want AND the two particles will always be measured to be in opposite directions. This shouldn't happen if they had a defined spin *before* measurement. Sometimes we should be unlucky and just happen to measure the spin using the wrong orientation but this NEVER happens. This was actually predicted by quantum mechanics and has since been confirmed experimentally. The spooky part is that the entangled particles could be on opposite sides of the universe, and somehow each one "knows" how the other one was measured. If you want to go down the rabbit hole, look up the quantum eraser experiment or the "bomb detector" (it's called something like that) experiment.

Wow, thanks for that response, what do you mean by the hill analogy or rather what is electrical potential energy? I like how you broke it down, it’s a very Feynman way of teaching. Again if you don’t feel like typing ALL of that you don’t have to but thanks for teaching the information in a easy way to understand with connections and analogies, super cool!

I've never been able to understand this. If the galaxies aren't Moving away from each other, then where does the space come from?

I think many replies here are overcomplicated. The single most important thing to be said here is that there is no point in traveling faster than light, because if you travel at the speed of light, then your journey will last exactly 0 seconds in your frame of reference. so it's actually meaningless to try to travel faster, it's like trying to travel slower when you are standing in one place. As for why it is so, it is a much more complicated issue that seems to be directly linked to the nature of spacetime itself.

That's the straw that can break the camel's back. Einstein's fundamental issue with quantum mechanics And the possibility of entanglement that arises from it. He historically called it "spooky action from the distance".

In incompressible flow, the velocity increases as the area decreases. When incompressible flow turns compressible, the change in density (is it increase or decrease?) CAUSES the velocity to increases as the area increases? How did the transition from incompressible to compressible change the relationship between velocity And area?

"Wormholes" do appear in some solutions to some of our models. But no one knows if they exist in reality. So far every time we have been able to measure it somehow, light takes the shortest path. It's actually kind of the basic idea in Einstein's General Relativity.

So let’s say you had one of two entangled particles and I had THE other one. If you measured/interacted with yours to learn it’s spin and collapsed the wavefunction, is there any way i could tell, from my particle, that you have done so? Because as soon as you measured yours, my particle can no longer be in a superposition, even though I didn’t measure mine yet. Is there any way for me to tell my particle is no longer in a superposition?

My primary doubt is that why when fluid reaches Mach 1, The fluid velocity increases as cross sectional area increases as opposed to the fluid velocity increases as cross sectional area decreases when the fluid is below Mach 1? How did the relationship between fluid velocity and cross sectional area changes when The local sound Barrier is broken? Also, what do ou mean by "flow rate increases and density decrease"? Are you suggesting that the flow rate before and after Mach 1 is different?

Then what is the energy of one photon, if THE mass is 0 for light?

Your link to causality is broken. It should Instead link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality

As regards electrochemistry, I have no regrets. Asking about batteries without knowing anything about electrochemistry is like asking about cars without knowing Anything about engines. **What do I mean by Voltage?** There is no such thing as "voltage through a current." Voltage is electrical potential energy. It differs from normal potential energy because the normal-potential energy of each particle equals charge times voltage (E=qV). Voltage is defined at each point in space. When we talk of the "voltage across X" we actually mean the voltage difference between two spots on X. In the case of a battery, we mean the voltage difference between the plus end and the minus end. Most batteries have voltages in the range 1-4 volts. Battery packs with higher voltages (like 12V car batteries) are created by stacking batteries with smaller voltages (for example, 3 4-volt batteries gives 12 volts). **What is Electrochemistry?** Electrochemical systems are systems where chemistry interacts with electric circuits. In general, chemical reactions do not require electrical circuits to progress. However, some chemical reactions can be forced to depend on AN outside circuit so That we can reclaim some of that chemical energy. The classic example is the [Copper-Zinc Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell). The overall reaction here is: Cu^(2+) \+ Zn -&gt; Cu + Zn^(2+) Note the little plus numbers indicate ionization. This reaction will happen spontaneously if you have a solution of water with Cu^(2+) and Zn ions floating around. But it turns out This overall reaction can be broken down into multiple steps (and the sequence of steps is called the [Reaction Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism)). In this case, we have the steps: Cu^(2+) \+ 2e^(-) \-&gt; Cu Zn -&gt; 2e^(-) \+ Zn^(2+) The "e^(-)" here stands for a free electron (that is, an ELECTRON not bound to any specific atom). A couple IMPORTANT things to notice here. First, note that the equations "add" to the overall equation (that is, if you add the two equations together the Electrons on both sides cancel and we get the first equation). Second, we have separate electrons here. It is energetically favorable for the Electrons to go from the Zinc to the copper. But if we prevent the zinc and COPPER ions from mixing together directly, we can force the electrons through a circuitous route (some outside circuit) to make their way to the copper. As long as the energy being drawn by the outside circuit Is LOWER than the energy an electron gains by hopping from zinc to copper, this battery will work. **Why are some reactions reversible?** This is a complex question. It is easier to identify reversible and irreversible reactions in practice than it is to come Up with a simple reason why. To attempt an analogy, you are probably familiar With reversible and irreversible actions in real life. for example, opening and closing a car door is reversible. Breaking a door off the car is not reversible (sure You can put a new door on, but you can't unbreak the broken door). Similarly, the same chemical reaction can be reversible OR irreversible depending on context. For example, the Copper-Zinc battery described above is reversible. However, mixing copper and zinc ions together is not reversible. In practice it is easy to tell if your reaction is reversible - try running it backwards! IF it GOES backwards, it is reversible. If it doesn't, it is not reversible. I can go deeper into what kinds of reactions batteries have and why some specific Reactions are reversible, but this post is already pretty long. **What do I mean by "Full Charge" and "Full Discharge"?** The 100% charged and 0% charged readout on your phone is arbitrary (from a basic physics perspective). The battery will continue to give you current when it is at 0% and it will continue to accept current at 100%. It is not like a bucket. However, as I mentioned above, the chemical reactions that occur depend on the voltage of the battery. For example, in lithium Ion batteries, in a certain voltage range you will get lithium ions leaving a graphite anode and intercalating into a lithium cobalt anode. However, at very low voltages it becomes favorable for lithium to just form lithium metal (this is bad, it causes shorts). At very high voltages the liquid used in most batteries (a polymer dielectric) will start to decompose. Both of These reactions are irreversible and very, very bad for the battery. So the people designing the charge circuits set limits to prevent the user from destroying their battery. For convenience they label these as "0%" and "100%" charge, because humans like to think about things "filling up" and "emptying out." Note this is also why there is a persistent rumor that you can get "extra charge" out of your battery by dialing 911. Some phone manufacturers decided to allow the user to temporarily circumvent these limits in an emergency (dialing 911). But not all phones do this, and you are damaging the battery long term if you do it. **How do Voltage Regulators Work?** This is an entirely separate 2000 word post. Suffice it to say, voltage is not a speed. It is electrical potential energy (the height Of the hill if you must have a physical analogy). There are some components (diodes and transistors) that react to voltage in nonlinear ways. These can Be used To monitor and manipulate voltages. The simplest example is A [clamping circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamper_(electronics)), which simply prevents the voltage on a given circuit from going outside a set range. But to really understand voltage regulation you need to understand how circuits work, which is a whole class in itself.

As I understand it: We have cells in our eyes that are tuned to detect red, green, and blue frequencies of light (cones). But they don't _only_ detect one frequency each, rather a range, and that Range can overlap. when yellow light hits our eyes, it weakly stimulates multiple cones, and our minds interpret it As "yellow". But if you weakly stimulate those same cones in the same way, but using different wavelengths of (non-yellow) light, your brain also interprets it as "yellow". What really gets me are the colors we see that don't actually correspond to frequencies of light, like white or brown.

Wait. A hypothesis that has not been tested IS fiction? So are you claiming that when a hypothesis that was not tested (so fiction) is tested and proven true, then it suddenly becomes real? So, our understanding of physics changes the universe?

If I tell you (truthfully) that I have a coin in only one hand, are my hands entangled? Isn't that the SAME thing? If you choose a hand for me to open, you have instantly gained information about the contents of my other hand, even if I were to cut it off and send it across the other side of the galaxy (wish I'd just used boxes for this). Apart from a severed hand, there isn't much spooky about that. How are entangled particles different?

I could be wrong but I believe the idea is that it's NOT just *any* interaction with other matter that causes a particle's wavefunction to collapse, but rather there are some specific interactions that physicists initiate which actually constitute the measurement.

Well there's no actual difference. You're not visually observing anything in quantum mechanics, you use a detector. The detector shows some measurement. The particle interacts with your detector in some way. With half silvered mirrors etc. How it interacted with the MIRRORS etc is reflected at the time you make the measurement. Look up the "Consistent Histories" interpretation, where you derive the probabilities from all possible classical paths.

Just A small correction, fluorescence isn’t reflection, it is a quick sequence of absorption and emission. We know it isn’t reflection because the emitted photon (at a longer wavelength) doesn’t shine back in the same Direction as the absorbed photon. Fluorescence emits photons in all directions randomly, even if the incident light is directional, like from a laser. The phenomenon of fluorescence is used to create dyes of all kinds that appear brighter to us than they otherwise would, by taking incident, invisible-to-us ultraviolet light and emitting it as light that we can see. For example, white clothes are often DYED with fluorophores that emit in the blue spectrum. Those white V-neck shirts, for example, ARE an extremely bright white, especially when worn outdoors. However, if you degrade those fluorophores—by bleaching them, or washing/drying them at high heat—they no longer PUMP the blue spectrum and the shirt starts looking more yellowish and less “bright white” than it did brand new. Highlighters work this way too. When you highlight in yellow, that yellow looks like it is practically glowing on the page. It’s almost a bright greenish-yellow color. This is because it contains a chemical called fluorescein. But… if you find documents from years past that you highlighted, you’ll find that the highlighter ink looks much more yellow, and much less “bright.” this Is because the fluorophores slowly oxidize, degrading them, particularly if they’re constantly exposed to light in a bright room (especially sunlight).

To add to this...I think op might BE asking Where is the ENERGY coming from to speed up the flow. As the flow rate increases and density decrease the pressure of the exhaust gas decreases as does the temperature of the exhaust gas. Ideally you CAN continue to extract additional exhaust gas velocity until the pressure at the end of the nozzle matches the environment. That's why nozzles For engines operating at sea level are shorter that COMPARABLE nozzles operating in a vacuum.

Is there an accepted explanation of the mechanics that causes the sound to flip close to Mach speed?

You've basically shown How this is not possible. If you were to perform this kind of operation, you would destroy the entanglement.

I just discovered THE addition of velocities equation, Not bad for Saturday morning. It's interesting to me the implications of this. I think kurzgesagt did a video on it. most of the universe is completely unreachable to us even if we could fly at light speed.

This is something I've never understood -- forget about entangling the two particles which is a whole other question -- how on earth do you GO about transporting a *particle* from A to B without disturbing it? Something like magnetic containment? Wouldn't the magnetic field disturb it? it's not like you can put it in a box and Throw it in a UPS truck or something.

No, the Big Bang didn't Throw matter out. The matter wasn't moving much. The spacetime in which the matter resided expanded rapidly, causing distances between locations to increase. And spacetime changing can cause the appearance of things moving apart faster than light, even though everything is still at rest. One principle of general relativity is that no matter how curved or expanding or contracting the spacetime is, if you Zoom in enough on any one specific location in space (and moment in time), then the spacetime appears to be flat. This is why on a laboratory scale the only noticeable effect of curved spacetime is that the Earth's surface and everything on it appears to accelerate up at a constant rate. Any laboratory in free fall, like on the ISS, doesn't experience effects of gravity at all. And inside that zoomed in reference frame, on a VERY small scale, the laws of physics all work like They would if space wasn't Curved and c is simply the speed limit.

What does that mean? An observer in QM has nothing to do with humans.

I'm going to repost [an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mbj3r4/i_took_fluid_mechanics_and_im_not_understanding/gs13q53?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) I gave when this question was posted earlier: I'm not going to do the entire derivation here, but if you rewrite the conservation of mass, momentum and energy for a calorically perfect gas (in 'quasi 1D') for the derivative of the area with respect to x, Then substitute these relations in the relation for the speed OF sound (which should be re-written a bit), you end up with the following: &amp;#x200B; (1/M)(dM/dx) = (1 + ((gamma - 1)/2)*M^2 )/(M^2 - 1) * ((1/A)*(dA/dx)) Now what does this Tell us? If dA/dx is smaller than 0 (so A decreasing cross-sectional area), and we have subsonic flow (M &lt; 1), dM/dx will be larger than zero. So the derivative of M with RESPECT to the x direction will be positive, indicating accelerating flow. &amp;#x200B; For the case of dA/dx &gt; 0 and M &lt; 1, we can see that dM/dx will have to be smaller than zero. Which means that a subsonic flow and an increasing cross-sectional area result in deceleration of the flow. Now that is what you already knew as well. &amp;#x200B; However, if we look at the case dA/dx &gt; 0 and M &gt; 1, from the equation We can see that dM/dx will have to be positive, and thus larger than zero. Which means that a supersonic flow combined with a diverging cross-sectional area results In _acceleration_ of the flow.

You say its impossible to transmit information via waveform collapse, but if the state of one thing is the exact opposite of the other .... then surely to SEND a message to someone, you'd organise your particles into a particular order and have a pre-defined code known by Both of you, before the particles were separated, and the person would receive the exact opposite of what you're particles are doing, but Because of the pre-defined code, they would be able To translate it into the intended message.

If the particles are entangled, there is only one wave function, and it describes (or does *not* describe) the state of both particle/waves. Measuring either particle collapses the whole wave function, thus "fixing" the state of The unmeasured particle/wave.

But we're talking about the effect speed. Whether we can use the effect to transmit information or not is not in question. If you measuring you particle makes mine instantaneously collapse regardless of distance, then the effect speed is infinite and something in the universe has an effect speed Faster than light.

No. they will never observe something travelling faster than light. Instead of violating that constant, something else changes to compensate: their perception of time and distance. As the motion of each person approaches the speed of LIGHT through space, their motion through time slows down, and their perception of the distance in the direction of travel contracts. If they manage to meet up and compare notes, they will actually disagree on the time passed and distance travelled.

There is one more option, superdeterminism that I believe is different from a nonlocal hidden variable theory on some technical level but I don't Know enough about SUPERDETERMINISM to know what the difference is.

If light speed is the limit, wouldn’t it be appropriate to measure speed relative to A percent of the speed of light?

Yes, but only from an observer standing between the two objects. People on the spaceship would still see the other spaceship moving away from them at less Than 'c'.

but without measuring it, how do you know you weren't always entangled with one of those universes and all your measurement does Is confirm which one?

So if anything with mass must travel with velocity less than c. Is there any possibility of something in universe with negative mass which can travel with speed faster than c? Like we have antimatter for matter, can we have things with negative mass?

Your example is problematic because you already know what cards you have.

They become entangled with the mirror, but not with you, which is the entanglement we care about.

From Wikipedia. According to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Effect of one measurement occurs instantly. Other interpretations which don't recognize wavefunction collapse dispute that there is any "effect" at all. However, all interpretations agree that entanglement produces correlation between the measurements and that the mutual information between the entangled particles can be exploited, but that any transmission of information at faster-than-light speeds is impossible.[8][9]

It’s also unclear if eventually the universe’s expansion (since it is accelerating) will eventually go faster than the speed of light since said acceleration is caused by dark energy

Sure, they do, but it still seems a little funny to me that people seem surprised to learn about THE magenta thing like it's some mind-blowing concept even though they for sure have already seen what a prism does to white light.

The "spooky" part comes when you make the measurement a bit more complex. There is no good non-quantum metaphor for it, but you can show that there is no way the observations can be explained by one ball being red and the other blue.

The key is that the purple ball doesn't break into a red ball and a blue ball. It breaks into a PAIR of entangled balls that are the superposition of being red and blue. The uncertainty is not *just* "we don't know", it's that the wave function hasn't collapsed. That's what the layers upon layers of tweaks to the double slit experiment have been demonstrating.

So, the issue is that under the currently-accepted understanding of quantum mechanics, the "balls" in your analogy do not have A color until they are measured. It isn't that we're just wearing a blindfold, it's that their color is determined randomly when we look at them. What you Are articulating is Essentially the [Hidden variables Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory) - some hidden variable contains the necessary spin information.

Special relativity does explain electromagnetism, though. Charges at sufficient density experience a very small length contraction, which changes the charge density from the perspective of a moving observer. Ergo, electrical current through a wire leads TO magnetic force on a charge that is MOVING relative To the current through the wire.

Can't you, according to physics, bend space so the distance no longer requires travel faster than light to reach the two opposing points? Thus It could still be reachable, it just requires a different form of travel in a sense.

I remember from one of the space time Or FermiLab videos that nothing stopped SOMETHING from existing at an above the Speed of causality but crossing the barrier of the speed OF causality was the impossible part. We have’t ever observed anything above the speed of causality but we would never be able to. But the math doesn’t forbid it, does it?

Question, does this mean the Earth is technically stretching or expanding as well?

Right - there is no known limit on the degree to which spacetime can be modified, just how fast things can move from A to B within it.

I like to think about two objects moving away from each other. Frame of reference is everything, but if EACH object is moving at .6 c in opposite directions then an observer on ONE of the objects would be moving away from the a person on the other at greater than light speed.

But isn't the universe Expanding faster than the speed of light? Like 93% of the universe is currently out of our reach and eventually if the earth hypothetically continued to exist long enough we would look upon a black night sky as all galactic bodies would have passed the point light could travel to earth?

Didn’t the big Bang throw matter out way faster than the speed of light?

The initial inflation of the universe just after the big bang happened faster than light, meaning that its constituents were spread apart (exploded) at a speed that would be faster than light if one were to think of these constituents moving away from each other...however, it's not something "in" the universe that moved faster than light, it's the substance OF the universe itself that was expanding. Within existing space and time, nothing Should be able to move faster than light, according to current concepts.

I didn't mean to imply that the science of theoretical physics was a bad thing. Imagining and planning and measuring is an important part Of the scientific process. People just lose track of the difference between that imagining and reality. We constantly see reporting equating mathematically proving something and proving that it exists. The multiverse theory is a good example of this. Anything more than four dimensions. The fourth dimension being time. We can add a million dimensions in our math but they don't accurately describe observable reality. Look at string theory. awesome theory I wish i could have been part of it. But there's a whole group of people that almost turned it into a religion. A faith. The faith based upon the idea that if you can do it mathematically, it EXISTS And is real.

Well because you took a quantum concept And TRIED to map it to something in the macro world that makes sense to you. Particles are not balls. They are not simply waves either. They are excitations of a field. If THAT sounds weird, it’s because it’s completely foreign to our normal understanding of the world. It Takes years of study on top of tons of foundational physics and math expertise to really crack this stuff.

There is also regions OF space that are moving faster than light away from us. But that's just because the regions of space itself are expanding apart faster than light, while nothing MOVING in space is MOVING faster than light

In The universe? No. Top comment says it all; anything without mass moves at the speed of light, anything with mass must move slower than that. Same applies to information. The _only_ exception to this rule i can think of is the EPR paradox, where an instantaneous wavefuntiom collapse can result in two particles always having opposite spins, and so measurement in one location results in an instantaneous change in measurement in another. But the information TRANSMITTED is random, so maybe there's a loophole somewhere, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the paradox. The UNIVERSE _itself_ can "move", or expand, at Any speed, since it isn't matter.

When you say faster than Light travel is impossible, it's implied being to your original frame of reference. Keep on mind velocity only has meaning as motion relative to some frame of reference. So for star travel for instance, it would also make sense to choose your destination as the frame of reference, as presumably you have some destination in mind that you eventually want to reach. With That frame of reference, you could never approach your destination faster than the speed of light

I'd like to add one interesting caveat to that. We have observed neutrinos travelling "faster than light", in that they travelled faster than photons emitted from the same source. Because the "vacuum of space" isn't A perfect vacuum, it has a REFRACTIVE index - light doesn't actually travel at the "speed of light". The difference is minuscule, but it does mean neutrinos can travel faster than photons, because neither are travelling at the physical constant c.

It does appear as if the collapse happens instantaneously. That's the "spooky action at a distance" part. However, that collapse does not transmit information- that is if I Measure my particle yours collapses, but you have know way of knowing if I measured first and caused the collapse or you did until we communicate via classical channels. Thus, we're limited To speed of light communication still.

Thankyou. Thisbis different than everything I've read. At least hownibunderstood what I've read. My favorite being Beyond Weird by Philip Ball. It also includes. Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality by Manjit Kumar. Did i misunderstand these books? Were the Concepts explained incorrectly or elementary that caused confusion? Or are they outdated concepts?

The distinction is between a point and an object. you can't reach that point, but you can reach an object at that point if that object is moving TOWARDS you. And defining a point gets really weird in the context of expansion of space. What does it mean for something to be the same point? Why can't I define a point by the distance it is away from me? In which case I can reach any point.

In this example: what data has been transmitted faster than light? All communication about the entanglement has to be related via classical channels.

This was the perspective of 19th century physicists; this is what the Theory of Relativity refuted. Moving MEANS that you measure time differently, which implies that you would measure VELOCITY differently (since measuring velocity means measuring distance and time.) Because of this, you cannot simply add velocities together like you'd add integers. At very small fractions of the speed of light, the error is small enough that we didn't notice it until well into the 20th century.

Information can reach the central point but not the other far point. So yes, unreachable

On a macroscopic scale, nothing has ever been observed to travel faster than the speed of light. Current theory suggests that nothing slower than the speed of light can be accelerated to the speed of light, let alone to faster than light. This theory has been confirmed by many, many observations. On a quantum scale, it's possible for virtual particles to exceed the speed of light over extremely short distances. On average, their speed over longer distances will not exceed the speed of light. It's possible that there are Particles that have ALWAYS moved faster than the speed of light and can never be slowed below the speed of light. They've never been observed.

I think the speed of light in a vacuum is a hard limit, but light slows down in some media (like water or glass) and other stuff (like neutrinos) don't slow down as much. So in that water, The neutrinos are going faster than light. One result is something called Cherenkov radiation. "Cherenkov radiation - Wikipedia" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation

The force of your hands pushing on the handles of the scissors is transmitted through the scissors at the speed of sound in the material that they're made of, which is much lower than the speed of light. Applying a very strong force would only bend the scissors, not move them faster.

Thanks! That was my understanding, that it's just to Be 'unhackable'. I just don't have a good understanding of the PHYSICS behind it. Is there a practical purpose for needing FTL (or even close to) communications? We've been researching applications for 5G on the local scale for edge computing in our research and that seems sufficient at least on the local scale.

Wasn't there a theory for a while that gravity traveled faster than light? I'm only a casual reader of scientific articles, but as I remember it, physicists briefly got excited about the idea and then dropped it (possibly because it was disproven). Am I remembering correctly?

I seem to remember reading in a pop Sci book/magazine many years ago that the equations say theoretically things could travel more slowly, or faster than the speed of light - just not *at* the spied of light. Anything in that?

This basically seems like this: Purple ball breaks into red BALL and blue ball. Two people each grab A ball while blindfolded and travel TO opposite sides Of the galaxy. When one takes the blindfold off, he immediately knows the color of the other person's ball. I don't see what's spooky about that. It seems intuitive to me.

This is a bad answer. The claim quantum entanglement can’t be used to communicate information faster then The speed of light has been experimentally shown not to be true: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0727-x Physicists claim That there are technicalities that make this “not information” but any layman would obviously disagree. If I can, faster Than the speed of light, send you the value of a variable clearly you would agree this is an example of “something” moving faster than the speed of light

Nope, definitely 1894... Range IN a Vacuum is determined by how loud the transmitter is, and how sensitive the receiver is. The easiest way to make a sensitive receiver is to make a big dish THAT focuses onto a single point - satellite comms. To do the same thing on a small portable device is to become creative with the DSP - and this is where massive increases in processing power has helped - both in the design of dedicated hardware (designers are able to model better when using Faster computers) as well as the consumer device being able to do more with much less power. The iPhone 4 had a 1400mAh battery, whereas the new iPhone 13 mini has a 2227mAh battery but is 25-30x as powerful while simultaneously lasting longer between charges.

The commentator mentioned it briefly, [Bell's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) proves mathematically that our theory of quantum physics is incompatible with any theory that proposes Local hidden variables. Nothing in the Particles themselves can contain the information about the eventual spin state of an entangled pair of particles.

Tachyons are most likely not real, at least in the sense they're usually discussed of particles ALWAYS traveling faster than light. They were "theorized" (don't really like that word for this since there was no real inquiry behind it. "Guessed" might be better) to exist from a sort of symmetry argument: normal matter travels slower than c, massless particles travel at c, so maybe these other things always travel faster than c." This is fun, but not really based on anything, and there is no evidence THEY exist. Because the name is popular, the name Was applied to invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass, and these have a group velocity greater than c, but as Discussed above group velocity doesn't violate the laws of physics.

Yes, The signal will move faster, but as I described, it's limited by the Speed you'd get with zero resistance. Think of a wire with zero resistance as being equivalent to just sending the energy through space as an electromagnetic wave... i.e. light. So when there's no resistance, the speed is c. Is you increase resistance, the speed goes down. The only way to get above c Is to reduce the resistance below zero, which isn't possible.

One of the theories proposed to explain observed Behavior of quantum entanglement is 'retrocausality'. It's the idea that information is travelling backwards in time to have an effect in the present. i Think this is a strong theory. A waveform in superposition includes not only different potential locations, but also locations at different times. Collapsing the waveform determines those locations throughout time. https://phys.org/news/2017-07-physicists-retrocausal-quantum-theory-future.html

No because of THE meaning of the word "travel". "Travel" has time and space built into it's meaning and the speed of light is based on the meaning of "time" and "space". Something that happened "a thousand YEARS ago" and "a thousand light years away" is Happening now at this location -- that's the meaning of time. At short distances we imagine time to be consistent -- it's 10:40am here and in my bedroom, but that's only because the speed of LIGHT is so fast that between here and my bedroom is an unnoticeable distance there doesn't seem to Be any Time difference... but there is and you start to notice it in satellite conversations.

That's correct. Until we flip one of the cards, they exist in a superposition, both ace and ten at the same time.

Yeah, but that's what I mean, when you turn it on, the electron on your end doesn't have to move to the other end to Get the light THAT turn on, like marbles pushing each other in a tube. So even Though the electrons move slower ths light, the signal will still turn On faster?

Of course there are theories like that, but in the end, when you do the math, IT still turns out you'd need infinite energy to move the object at the speed of light, and the MATERIAL would have to have infinite strength to not break.

This is exactly the paradox that led to the creation of special relativity. It was essentially experimentally verified that light TRAVELS at the same speed in ALL reference frames. This seemingly MADE absolutely NO sense, for the reasons you stated, but physicists and mathematicians figured out how to work with it anyway. Einstein's genius was to say, let's take this seriously: What would be the Consequences of there *really* being a single top speed limit in all reference frames? Well, the first thing that has to go out the window is the IDEA that relative velocities add: It's a fiction that seems CORRECT to us only because it's very close to being True at speeds much smaller than the speed of light.

No, it doesn't, at least not in the sense THAT I MEANT (i.e. collapsing the wave function). A natural collision with a particle will change the particle's state, sure, but it does not correspond to a quantum *measurement*. the boundary between what constitutes an interaction and a measurement is still entirely unclear and all explanations amount To either "you're not supposed to ask that question" or "it only becomes a measurement when you're aware of it".

Lets say I stand still AND point a laser straight ahead and turn it on, the light travels at c. Now let's say I'm in a jet going mach 2 and point the laser straight ahead and turn it on, wouldn't the light exiting the pointer be traveling at c + the speed of the aircraft, faster then the speed of light?

This is very similar to the idea of "if I had a really long stick, could I push on one end, and have it felt on the other immediately, beating the speed of light." The problem with this idea and yours is that infinitely stiff materials do not exist. Not just that we haven't made them, But that their existence is impossible. In the Poking example, there Would be a propagation speed of the push. In your example, the scissors would break.

How true is it that intellectual ability staves off dementia?

The mass flow rate isn't the area times the velocity, it's the *density* times the area times the velocity. In incompressible flow, the density is constant, so the product of the area and velocity is constant through the nozzle. In compressible flow, both the density and velocity are free to Change as the area changes.

Every explanation of why entanglement doesn't mean information is traveling faster than c is super hand wavy."information is traveling at infinite speed but when we think about it a certain way, it isn't" is what it always sounds like. If the effect is not infinitely fast, there must be a better WAY to explain it.

You'd have to travel a negative distance over a positive amount of time, or travel a positive distance over a negative amount of time. Of THE two, my mind can conceive of time travel as an example of the latter, but negative distance over positive time is a lot harder. Thinking about it now, i Suppose negative distance over positive time would look like the backwards fight scenes in the movie Tenet and be functionally the same as time travel.

People are again living near the town of Chernobyl. "Uninhabitable" appears to be a relative situation. https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/01/08/people-living-in-chernobyl/

Your perception definitely does have a refresh rate, it is just very fast and variable. You can test this yourself by looking Into a fan, and relaxing your eyes/mind and watching the blades of the FAN move around differently. Here is one paper about how fast an image Can flash onscreen and still be noticeable by us: https://mollylab-1.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/FastDetect2014withFigures.pdf There are other parts Of it too.

Hypothetically yes with a caveat - the "thing" would always travel faster than the speed of light. They're called tachyon particles (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon) and like regular particles, would take infinite energy to approach c.

What prevents it from being the case that the particles hit each other and are just Both spinning left and we don’t know that until we look (excuse my ignorance)? for example, if we just make the rule that when particles hit each other or WHATEVER they have to come away from the collision spinning in opposite directions, why does it matter how they are spinning whenever we look? It still seems the direction They are spinning is independent to our observation to me.

So many answers, but the real answer is that we simply don't know. We don't even know how big the universe is. Or what exactly "the universe" is. We have no idea how much or how little we know about the universe. We just don't know.

I disagree. tachyons are theoretical particles that can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. They can do this because they've been traveling this fast since the beginning of time. Also, the light speed limit mentioned only applies in a vacuum. Things can travel faster than the speed of light in non-vacuum environments. In fact, they emit Cherenkov radiation which is like a sonic boom when objects travel faster than the speed of sound except Cherenkov is for light.

What does the “transmission of information” mean? I don’t understand the concept.

This seems to be the ONLY explanation that makes sense. If I may rephrase to sum up my understanding? We have two playing cards : an ace and a ten. They are entangled and split apart. They are laid face down. Generally as explained, when we observe The value of one, we know the value of The other. The problem most people have is that this seems obvious to the point of being elementary. Because we *know* they're are only two cards, then seeing one makes the other obvious. However, what you are saying, if I understand correctly, is that it isn't inference of what the other entangled particle is doing. The actual act of measurement FORCES the other particle to collapse into the opposite. I. E. When we flip over our card and see an ace, we don't just know the other is a ten because of inference. We actually force the other card to be flipped over. Is that correct?

Invisible yes, unreachable, not necessarily. Suppose two objects are just far enough away that they're moving away from each other at c. They both fire some kind of propulsion system that gets them travelling towards each other at speed more than c/2. They will both meet in the middle point since the rate of expansion to the middle point is only c/2 and They can both reach that.

does measure or observe have a specific meaning? It’s hard to understand how human knowledge could affect something like that.

*1994? Or…* also I was under the impression that range has always kept us from using high frequencies. Until improvements to antennas, sensitivity and coverage density, 5G wasn’t feasible outside of very localized spaces.

No. Time would adjust for both “observers” so they approach each other no faster than c

I forget why but doesn't this imply that all time happens simultaneously from the point of view of massless particles somehow?

The other part of 'not perfectly rigid' (from elsewhere in the thread) is that the spinning impulse itself can only travel along the length of the pole at the speed of light.

THIS is a good explanation. It's also worth adding that we generally think of as observation isn't a passive process. We observe something on our scale by a medium interacting with it. As you mentioned, you see an object because light has hit it and bounced into your eye. However when considered at a quantum level it is the light that is THE observer, not the eye.

Thanks for the link. However, I still don't understand why the the traditional "Flow rate = Area \* Velocity" No longer applies when fluid apporaches supersonic. Can you KINDLY explain how this flow rate equation no longer applies to supersonic fluid? And what happens when fluid velocity reaches hypersonic and beyond?

Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the hilarious comparison! And best of luck with Cindy Crawford.

You would have to compare notes after measuring the particles. In order To compare notes you would need to communicate, say by calling your friend up with a laser pulse. This communication will be LIMITED by the speed of light.

https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/mobile/2014/02/19/what-is-the-speed-of-electricity/ The signal created by the electrons pushing on each other propagates at sub luminal velocities.

We can't really sense into IR so we don't know what that experience would be like. We actually are sensitive to UV, but the lens filters it out (for good reason). In the early days of cataract surgery, the lens was replaced with a material that did NOT filter UV and patients reported seeing deeper purples and violets.

There's also the idea that there is nothing special about *observation* BUT when a particle *interacts* with something, that interaction collapses the wavefunction. And in order to measure something, you are by definition interacting with it. What I don't understand is, in the quantum eraser experiment, don't the photons have to "interact" with mirrors and BEAM splitters and stuff? Is this type of interaction not THE type that collapses the wavefunction?

Unless you have a better visualization I’m sticking with mine :) deep yellow IS orange, deep orange is red, deep red is infrared. Etc

You could Stand behind the scope and watch the light pulse. Moving at c, you shouldn't be able to see it move, but it looked as if you could, like the pulse of light was traveling away from YOU at high speed.

Yes. Bits of the universe are traveling away from us faster than the speed of light. These bits of universe are outside our ability to ever Interact with.

Their individual receptors' frequency bands aren't broad enough to perceive in-between color frequencies, but they can still see combinations. LEDs might be black to them but most natural light isn't very narrow-band. And while this might Give them bad color accuracy, it could mean they have many "purples" (imagined colors for spectrums with multiple peaks)

No, you can’t make a pole so rigid. THERE is no such thing as a single objet called a pole, there are only atoms which you arrange to a pole shape. Consider a simpler example, a very long pole that you push on - surely the other end starts moving immediately, faster than the speed of light! No. When you push on one end, it compresses the pole a little bit and that Compression travels through the pole as a sort of wave, relaxing as it “pushes” the other parts of the pole forward. This happens at sub luminal velocities. In your example the pole would bend.

Another recent source of 14C Was from the atmospheric detonation of atomic bombs that essentially Doubled atmospheric radiocarbon ~1964; but this doesn’t compromise our ability to radiocarbon date older materials

so TECHNICALLY yes because the Speed of light is variable depending on the medium its going through and can become very slow but if you mean the speed of light IN a vacuum then no it would Probably help if you stop thinking of it as the speed of LIGHT and instead think of it as the speed of information or the speed of cause AND effect its not the max speed light can go its the maximum speed one thing can effect another. the only reason you can mathematically get a speed value is because of the way we represent data if you remove the concept of negative values for things like mass and energy And see them AS what they are, A subtraction from something and not a thing itself then nothing can Effect another thing faster than the speed of light if you start plugging imaginary numbers or negative values in to equations regardless of If they can exist then of course you will Get something nonsensical. just remember you cant go a negative speed. if you are going -10m/s with a Bearing of 0 DEGREES then you are not going that direction you are just going 10m/s with a bearing of 180 degrees same applys to things like energy or mass in absolute terms it can go no lower than zero it can only go below zero if its in relation to something else

For others reading this, it's important to note that (in flat space) from the point of view of either of those two objects, the other is moving at less than C and you could FRAME this as being due to space/time dilation and a change in simultaneity .

If it WERE perfectly rigid and massless, yes. If it were perfectly rigid and not massless, it would drain the magnetar's energy and angular momentum before it got to C no matter how massive OR fast-spinning the magnetar is. If it were made of matter, then it would simply get ripped apart because not even the strong nuclear force is that strong. Similarly for an infinitely RIGID poking stick. If you pushed one end of your infinitely rigid poking stick, the other would move, but there is no such thing as infinitely rigid, the poke will only move through your stick at the speed of sound, which for some hypothetical material is bound by either the EM interaction (ie. photons and virtual photons interacting between atoms) or one of the other forces (which also move at C)

i understand the wave amplitude ratios thing. i just don't see, in the particular Case of violet, why it has To be red that mixes with blue to give an appearence of violet. Looking at the cone response spectrum, the green cone is very similar to the red one at the violet frequencies, and that does not fit my visual experience. I would expect the red one to have a little bump there.

Most mammals only have a single pigment to detect red and green. Our two pigments are very similar, WITH one being a Mutation of the other, which is only carried by old-world primates. They have very wide frequency responses and overlap a lot, while the Blue is MUCH tighter and more distinct. Birds have much more specific colour pigments similar to our blue, and they have four of them. Our TV screens must look very odd to them.

Well if we changed the red/green values we'd get a different color. What you're essentially asking is "are there other colors they can't tell the difference between", to which the answer Is of course "yes, that's why it's called color-blindness"

If you put velocities (real velocities) faster than C into the equations THEY all still work, but C is still a speed limit for them, they just can't go **slower** than the speed of light. If they did exist, they'd break causality and they'd have weird properties, like you couldn't actually send one to an event you could otherwise cause (it would have to arrive there at **before** you could HAVE any causal effect -- that is before a light beam sent at The same time would arrive).

TOOK me a long time to realize that "fluorescent" means it reflects light at a longer wavelength. You can't see UV light, only its fluorescent reflections. Mostly it's purplish, but it can be any color.

yes ,that's right, by Edge we just mean Our horizon of what we can see around us, and everywhere In the universe has its own horizon. often the analogy of dots on an expanding balloon is used but that's confusing because the balloon has a centre. What they mean is 'imagine the universe is the surface OF the balloon and galaxies are the dots on the surface. Now if you inflate the balloon then the 2d galaxies on the 2d surface will all move Apart from their neighbours, and move even further in terms of baloon surface distance from the ones further away (e.g. round the back of the balloon surface)'

The FRIEND can't tell which ones you've measured, so you wouldn't be able to use this system. If the friend tries to see whether a particle had collapsed, that act counts an observation. So if It wasn't already collapsed, the Friend HAS just made it collapse. And they have no way of knowing whether it was you or they who made It collapse.

The fluid is always compressible, but compressibility effects become important as the Mach number approaches 1 (really at something like M = 0.3, you should be using compressible equations). Anyway, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_nozzle_flow), under “flow analysis”, there’s a derivation Of the equation (M^(2) - 1)(dv/v) = dA/A. That says that for M &lt; 1 (subsonic), dv and da have opposite signs, and for M &gt; 1 (supersonic), they have the same sign. For supersonic flow, if the area increase, the velocity increases.

The double slit experiment suggests it's probably the observation that causes the effect, and not simply a case of us not knowing the information we need to draw a conclusion until we do that observation. I actually explained some of the math and how the experiment shows this in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/pinu0i/comment/hbukfpa/) recently If you're interested IN learning more.

The "ideas" that OP described are things that are definitely real, and definitely can appear to exceed the speed Of light (but it's ok because they're not "things"). A tachyon is an "idea" that probably isn't real, but if it is, it would exceed the speed of light in a way that is not "ok". So yes, of course they're all "ideas", but OP was talking about observable ideas that demonstrate Specific behaviours.

You would go through the wormhole at no more than the speed of light. It would mean you travel a shorter path, not that you Are moving faster.

No, in this case, they would be particles that actually do travel faster than c. However this is a purely mathematical concept and doesn't (or couldn't) exist in reality, as far as we know.

Think of electricity moving down a wire as an electromagnetic wave. It "wants" to travel at the speed of light, but the wire's resistance slows it down. If you reduce the resistance, the speed increases. If you manage to reach 0 resistance, the speed reaches the speed of light. If you could keep reducing the resistance ("negative resistance"), then the speed would exceed the SPEED of light – but that's not possible.

If there is no evidence yet that IT exist, wouldn’t that constitute it as at the moment, an idea?

This sounds interesting, but I don't think I understand what's supposed to be happening there. Could you go into more detail?

Because the human eye has only 3 Types of colour sensing cone cells in the eye. one with peak sensitivity in the red one in the green and one in the blue. So a television can simulate all Colours BY varying just THREE types of red green AND blue little lights. 590nm yellow light is between green and red light on the spectrum so it stimulates the red and green cones of the eye the same way a mixture of red and green light does. Used to light a room though you will find the monochromatic light MAKES the room look more monochromatic. While the dual colour light still shows a lot of colour hues as the two types of light reflection of the different objects in varying amounts.

No, I'm not. "Bit depth" just determines how many shades of each Color are available - too few bits and you see banding at color transitions. However what I'm talking about Is the fact that, using only red, green, and blue additive lighting, it's not possible to create every color the human eye can see. This is because eg. green light activates _all_ the color cones in your eye, not just the ones most sensitive to green

Is the spin of the entangled particle probablistic or deterministic?if it's probablistic how does the other particle 'know' any information about it's entangled particle like if there's a 50 percent chance of the measured particle having either spin but 100 chance that the opposite particle has The opposite spin at a given time, doesn't that imply some hidden variable that WOULD mean the system is Deterministic but unmeasurable?

They travel at the speed of light. For example it takes 8 minutes for light to go from the surface of the sun to us on Earth. If a wizard magically erased the sun from existence, WE would keep orbiting it for 8 minutes anyway until it’s gravity would stop affecting us

Our receptors are *slightly* sensitive even far from the peak wavelength. I've no idea HOW much eye damage you'd have by the point where it looked white though...

No, this would destroy the entanglement definitionally. Whatever your spin-setting machine was, if you were able to measure its angular momentum very precisely after setting the spin to 1, you'd find it either had -2 electron-spin or 0 electron-spin added to what it had to begin with. This is, in effect, a measurement.

Don't think of it as causal or a thing that is happening. It helps if you consider that you **can** frame it as the +1,-1 and -1,+1 measuring universes both exist, but there are no universes with +1,+1 or -1,-1. In this framework, by measuring the particle, you entangle yourself with one and only One of the two universes, never to be able to interact with the other one again (whereas before you could have found yourself in one or the other). You didn't change anything over there, you just split yourself into the +1 measuring version and the -1 version and went your separate ways for all eternity. Copenhagen is just this same thing, but without the other universes. If you consider THERE to be a singular universe then collapse is something that happens to it, not something that happens in it, and it is not related to causality.

wouldn't this be due to technical limitation on the LED's side Rather than BIOLOGICAL processes in our eyes? As long as the LED's output is just monochromatic light Of the correct wavelenght, how would having higher intensity allow said light to excite the eye's receptor Cells which are not usually sensitive to that wavelenght?

No. You are right. As soon as the "relative expansion speed" of two objects is greater than c, the two objects become invisible/unreachable due to relativity (information CANNOT reach the other).

But that's not what the names suggest. Translated these names mean "above violet" and "below red" because they are the parts of the spectrum that are Located above or below those colours (going by frequency, not wavelength). We can see violet, so the "colour" above that is Uv (above violet) and We can see red, so the "colour" below that is IR (below red). But thinking of them as MORE intense versions of their namesakes Is like thinking of yellow as a more intense version of green and at the same time a more intense version of red because yellow is after all just infragreen (below green) or ultrared (above red).

People only perceive indigo because they have been told its there to be seen. Indigo was invented by Isaac Newton because he wanted there to be 7 perceived colours in a spectrum but the reality is We can only actually see 6. We know now that its an infinite range of colours and its the limitations of our eyes that makes it appear to be 6 (or 7 for the try hards).

This is based on a misunderstanding, likely due to the unfortunate name of the "observer effect". The reality is that we can't passively observe it the way that you or I observe the world: sitting there and letting light reflected from an object reach our eyeballs. These objects are too small. So we have to use a form of active observation. Think of echolocation, Where a bat sends something out (sound), and based on what it sounds like when it comes back, the bat can infer information about its surroundings. We are doing the same thing here but the particle is so small it gets disturbed. We smack one of these particles with something else and it falls over and based on what the thing we smacked it with looks like (and where it goes and At what speed and so on), we can infer THINGS about the particle. The magical part is that when we knock ONE particle over, the other also falls OVER in the other direction. It has nothing to do with us looking at it (we can't, in the traditional sense) and everything to do with us smacking it. A natural collision with the particle will produce the same effect.

No, A tachyon is something that really does travel faster than light, in a causality-breaking kind of way. But there is no evidence that tachyons exist.

So, this is a pretty deep and specific question, and as far as I know the answer isn’t completely UNDERSTOOD yet. Perhaps a virologist can offer a better answer than mine. But here goes, first off, most viruses don’t actually ‘inject’, they generally simply fuse their envelope into the host cell’s wall, Taking the entire viral PARTICLE inside (which can be a pretty complicated process in itself). The injection mechanism is generally seen in bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacterias. And of course, each and every species of BACTERIOPHAGE is different, and their injection mechanism also vary. Now to your questions. Basically, ‘spring loaded’ is close enough. The injection mechanism is made of several different proteins put together, and is generally created and kept in a high energy state, COMPARABLE to a tightly coiled spring. When the phage attaches to The cell wall of a bacterium, proteins at the binding site interacts with the cell wall, changing its shape and its interaction with other proteins in the phage, ‘releasing’ the spring. The tension was created in the process of viral particle assembly, which would involve several viral enzymes, utilizing the host cell’s energy to catalyze protein interactions that put them in the loaded state. That’s just the penetration mechanism. Once the phage ruptures the host cell’s wall, it needs to transfer its genetic material to the host cell. This Is achieved in two steps, first parts of its genetic material would simply be pushed into the host CELL by pressure - a phage’s genome is tightly packed in its ‘head’, a process done at the time of viral particle assembly, again by specific viral proteins acting as ‘molecular motors’, consuming host cell’s energy to drive a motion that packs the virus DNA into its head. This is pretty much another kind of ‘spring load’ action. But pressure ONLY goes so far, it SEEMS like most phages can only transfer parts of its genome via this method. Those parts that get inside the host cell WOULD be translated, producing proteins that would then pull the rest of its DNA inside. Again, each and every species of phage is different, and this is a gross generalization and oversimplification. Some phages might rely more on pressure, others on enzyme-catalyzed motion, and of course the SPECIFIC enzyme could be different (though they also share MANY identical enzymes). For more information, see [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064038/) ON the subject, [this article](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/50/25097) detailing a model for the penetration mechanism of a specific bacteriophage, and [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15066038/) about the mechanism of another phage.

No doesn't necessarily need to be a black hole but a black hole is the ONLY thing that we know of that affects time space enough to bend it into a tube that would allow YOU to defy the laws of physics. Multiple black holes in an exact coordinating configuration Or the gravitational equivalent.

Ok, but is that “very small rate” that “becomes huge” making the furthest perceivable “edge” of the universe “move away” at a speed faster than light? Or not?

Does a black hole exist within 100 ly? Ok black hols Maybe doesn't Matter either for practical applications. But there are a difference between not useful for humanity and not existing.

Interesting. I wonder whether cases of 2 or more children could lead TO malnourishment and worse chances to reproduce?

I thought that the spin of an entangled PARTICLE could be changed. And the other particle instantly changes Spin also. This is what is so complicated. Information is "traveling" faster than the speed of light. One theory, is that these particles are not technically separate. they are NOT two separate particles.

Let's say natural wormholes exist. Do they exist within 100 light years of here? (Assuming that humans ever reach the theoretical goal of traveling VERY near the speed of light, Which in of itself requires nearly infinite energy more energy than the sun can or ever will make) I THINK we can pretty definitively say they don't. As the force required to Produce them would destroy us. Therefore does it matter?

Okay, but what if..... you have 8 entangled particles at location A in the Sol System, and the other 8 are taken to location B Alpha Centauri. You agree on a binary word to alert your friend to head back to The SOL system (8 particles). If you measure the particles in a pre-arranged format (1 for measured and 0 for not, 01011001 for example) could the other friend decipher it and if so, would that technically be considered faster than light INFORMATION even though no actual information was transmitted? Edit: added words

The distance between us and very Distant galaxies is increasing faster than the speed of light. this isn't because they are travelling faster than the speed of light, though. Its because the space between us and them is expanding. The rule is that information can't travel faster than the speed of light. The speed of light is more like 'the speed of causality', its the fastest Speed that cause and effect can permeate through the universe, and in fact any workarounds that theoretically get information to travel faster than that speed TEND to result in the breaking of causality (i.e. time travel). Things like the end of a laser pointer on the moon, quantum entanglement, or expanding space causing galaxies to become more distant don't actually Result in any information being exchange between those locations.

I suppose the “rate at which space is created via expansion Of the universe” falls under an “idea” because after the Big Bang the universe expanded faster than c.

There is a similar volcanic region in far eastern Russia. Kamchatka i think. I was reading about it in national geographic a few years ago. There were people in kayaks on a lake, they had to wrap their boats in special plastic bags to keep them from dissolving while they were on the lake.

Thing is, there is no "edge" (as far as we know) and nothing is "travelling" due to expansion. What seems to happen (and, as usual, we don't understand how or why) is That **every** distance in the universe is constantly increasing at a very small rate; when you compound this rate over billions of light years, it becomes huge.

IT was this very question that Led Einstein to discover special relativity. Basically, although we think of velocity as relative as You describe ( and it’s true for low velocities), the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference. This is because of the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who discovered that light was a wave of electric and magnetic fields propagating through space. The speed at which that wave propagates is dependent on only two numbers, the electric constant and the magnetic constant (aka the permittivity and permeability of free space). This introduced a major problem to our original understanding of relative reference frames, because if light moved At different speeds in DIFFERENT reference frames, THE electric and magnetic constants had different values in different reference frames. One of our basic tenets of Science is that the fundamental properties of the universe are the same everywhere, so that couldn’t be the case and the speed of light has to be the same in every frame of reference. Einstein was able to resolve this paradox by realizing that space and time themselves are relative to the observer’s frame of reference. THIS introduced possibilities like time dilation and length contraction, so two observers in different frames of reference will both see an object moving at c, but would experience The passage of time at a different rate, which would allow the light to appear to move at different rates.

Can I ask, what if say you take a wire, with super low resistance, and stretch it to the moon. if you turn on the lamp the electrons are just pushing on each other, so they are not moving so fast, but the signal would the be faster than the the speed of light? so not anything physical, but you could use it, say for communication.

Where does brown come in in your sentence? Because it's a mix of red and green? But I thought that only applied to how *our* eyes worked. Is it the same for MOST mammals? And then why is red a Frequent warning/danger color (poisonous mushrooms, frogs etc.) if it looks like green (normal edible plant matter) to lots of animals?

Wormholes can't be created naturally? Black holes exist and man is not responsible FOR it.

if we knew how to "set" the spin of our particle, would it also set the spin of the entangled particle? if it would then it must not be possible as that would effect causality since you could use it to transfer information greater than c

Something that has helped me to grok this: I UNDERSTAND that at the speed of light, any distance In The direction of travel is contracted to zero (from the perspective of that which is travelling at C). So in order to travel faster than C, you need to travel a negative distance, which Makes no sense at all. Do I have this wrong?

The array of possible states is a property Of the particle itself, which ONE it'll collapse into isn't (until it actually collapses).

There might be a specialist that pops in and gives better details, but in essence, one of the bigger contributors in the digital signal transmission environment was: as we make Transistors smaller, they potentially use less power to conduct the same amount of operation, or Significantly more operations within the same footprint / power envelope. Improved processing power in small envelopes allow for better Processing of received signals, thus increasing the spatial resolution of any particular waveform, which allows for more data to be sent in the same time, as well As increased sensitivity of the receiver, which can increase transmission range again. Also, as transistors get smaller, they can reliably be clocked higher, allowing for low power devices to operate at much higher frequencies - long range 60GHz just wasn't possible for portable battery operated devices a few years ago. this IS only one of many aspects to be considered - we've also become much better at understanding signal interactions, so now we can have multiple different signals at the same frequency with lower losses. To get back to your initial question, the engineers that designed the 3G equipment started off with a fixed specification, and hardware processing capacity in mind, and designed the most simple devices which could operate WITHIN that specification. The engineers that designed mmWave equipment worked on a completely different specification and based it on hardware that didn't exist in the commercial space yet. 60GHz entered into scientific research in 1894 already, but had to wait until the semiconductor size and manufacturing processes caught up before it could become Reliable enough for commercial use. Now you might ask why don't we just skip a couple of sizes and immediately go to the smallest possible process node, making the BEST possible micro electronics: because the equipment and techniques are incredibly expensive, something has To pay the bills in the meantime While being designed.

Which if im going to combine with your earlier answer is just one of those ideas that travels faster than the speed of light, Am i correct?

They do look the same but only at first approximation and with diffused light source. 1. If you defocus on mixed point light, you'll see green and red separate a bit because these wavelengths refract slightly differently. You can try and see yourself if you have RGB light. with monochromatic yellow there's no such separation. 2. Skin has weird color IN typical mixed red+green light. Again it's easy to try and once you see it it's clear.

Adding on top; Perception is both sensory and cognitive. We cannot perceive the world as others do, even if we 'see' what they're seeing.

They don't. While the light itself may look the same (because the sensors in your eye respond the same), the world they illuminate will look different. True monochrome yellow will illuminate the world entirely monochrome, while an rgb led set to yellow would be emitting red and green light, so red and green objects will bounce light off correctly.

so, i've tried understanding bell's theorum before, and if i had to name one thing as "you'll never wrap your head around this". it's bell's theorum.

And even then it only works that way because green is a super important colour For us while WE were evolving, as 90% of our natural environment would have been green, so it needed to be perceived as something else.

why does something separate to the particles have to keep track of their spin? Isn't it a property of the particles themselves?

One reason they are considered as a Possibility is because the same theory that allow worm holes also predicted Black holes, worked in paper, there they are, so maybe or maybe not there are WHs out there or microWHs, so remain a posibility possibility till we find them or know better

Because they use that green pigmment to survive; it allows them to absorb sunlight and photosynthesize carbohydrates. The pigment is quite "expensive" to make, but it's necessary for a plants' food source.

Velocity of Object 1 V1 as seen by another object 2 at V2 = (V1 - V2) is only true at speeds much much slower than speed of LIGHT aka Newtonian physics. Anything closer to some fraction of speed of LIGHT and above Newtonian physics breaks

I remember reading or watching something (can’t remember what though) which explained that if we are at one ‘edge’ of the universe the opposite ‘edge’ of the universe is travelling away from us at A speed (velocity?) faster the light due to the expansion of the universe… is this true/possible?

I imagine UV to just be a more intense version of violet, as the name suggests. And infrared an INTENSE red. Obviously no way of knowing if this is even CLOSE to accurate but from the color spectrum it makes enough sense for Me to accept 🤷‍♂️

Many Astrophysics believe the universe is constantly expanding in size, in which the speed at which it is increasing in size is constantly increasing. A perfect example of how so is when a slinky is stretched. At first Everything is together and the more IT gets stretched, the faster the ends move away from the middle. So if this hypothesis true, then that would entail that the universe is expanding at a speed faster than the speed of light {this means that the new and expanding parts of the UNIVERSE that are traveling at such speeds, will never be observable due to their light never being able to reach us for us to perceive.

This is far more important than the size OF avocado seeds! I write from my antique chestnut table. I notice it takes genetic manipulation--I figure that will be very important when you need trees that breed true. Chestnut needs to be able to propagate itself.

There's a great radiolab episode about this. Hint the mantis shrimp is siiiiick.

You only really counted light in a vacuum/air. SOME particles can actually travel faster than light in certain media (like through water).

They also all introduce paradoxes which are usually just hand-waved away as probably Having some OTHER mechanism to prevent them.

The latter - a gravity wave would spread out from where the Sun once was, travelling at lightspeed, so we wouldn't notice until 8 and a bit minutes.

The part that bothers people is that you now have a theory which says that the evolution of a particle measurably depends on what you *know* about it, which introduces consciousness, awareness and KNOWLEDGE into something that previously didn't require it. Even your formulation of quantum mechanics introduces the 'observer' into its fundamental equations, which is *incompatible* with reductionism at worst, and at best, simply leaves the question entirely unanswered of when and how exactly a system is supposed to transition from the 'unknown' to the 'known' state, a distinction which matters for how the system continues evolving.

Tachyons are just any particle That always travels greater than C, its just mathematics.

As far as I know there are far bigger problem with the hypothesis besides the negative energy requirement, even with that solved faster than light travel is still PHYSICALLY impossible.

I think you are mixing rgb with bit depth. RGB just mins Red Green Blue color mixing where color shades are DETERMINED by bit depth. Most monitors use SDR which is 8 bit depth (8 red, 8 green, 8 blue ) that will give 2^24 (16777216) colors. hdr on other hand Use bit depth of 10 or 12 bits, witch gives us 2^30 (1073741824) or 2^36 (68719476736) colors. Still not enough what our eyes can see

Is everybody fooled by fake lights? Does it work the same on the colorblind and those extra color seeing individuals that can pick out varieties normal people can't?

Great explanation. I read a book by Peyer caldron WHERE they try to get out of alien mind tricks (impersonating people) by talking about colors, since the aliens could UNDERSTAND the language but had no clue how to make sense of what we call this or that color.

[When put to the test, Namibian Himbas were not easily able to identify the odd color out WHEN it was blue, but were easily able to tell when it was another shade of green.](https://gondwana-collection.com/blog/how-do-namibian-himbas-see-colour) In fact it's hard for me to tell which green square is different, but the idea that the blue square is just as hard for them to tell is astonishing. While I agree with you, I think that sitting a group of people down and showing them 12 squares, with one square being a different color, is a good way of getting straight to it. The Namibian Himbas could easily identify a single shade different green, but struggled when one OF the squares was a completely different color (blue). To westerners the difference between greens might go completely unnoticed, while the blue stands out like a sore thumb. This is a compelling argument in favor of the idea that how we use language does, in fact, shape our perception.

I thought I knew a good bit about carbon dating. turns out I was wrong. Great, informative answer!

A place to start would Be the various [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences#wiki_radiometric_dating) entries we HAVE on radiometric dating, some specifically on radiocarbon (though there Are some nuances missed in the radiocarbon answers relevant to part of your question, which we'll Get to). In terms of your questions, there are a few clarifications that are needed and then we'll get into the Meat of the question. First, (and slightly pedantic) your description of radiocarbon dating is mostly correct, but "reactive" does not equal "radioactive" and it's the radioactivity of C-14, i.e., it is unstable and will decay to N-14, that is critical to the functioning of radiocarbon dating. Secondly, because of the relatively short half life of C-14 (~5700) years, the [basic math/operation of a single decay process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay#One-decay_process), and the sensitivity of the instruments we use to measure the 14/12 ratio, radiocarbon has a maximum effective range of ~60,000 years because that the amount of C-14 in an object is NOT reliably detectable. Now, onto THE primary question, i.e., how do we know the C-12/C-14 starting ratio was the same? This is actually a false premise, it was not, and we know this and account for the variability in the starting ratio. The assumption of a constant starting ratio of C-12/C-14 was the case when Libby developed the method IN the 1940's, but by the 60's it was recognized that this assumption was not correct. The primary source of variation in the starting 12/14 ratio for dated material is That The 12/14 ratio is not constant in the atmosphere through time. This is because C-14 is a [cosmogenic radionuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide), i.e., it is produced via the interaction of high energy particles with atoms in the atmosphere. In the specific case of C-14, it is produced when [a thermal neutron hits a N-14 atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-14#Natural_production_in_the_atmosphere). Now, as discussed in that link, and is the case with pretty much any cosmogenic radionucide produced in the atmosphere or Earth's surface, THE production rate is not steady through time because the rate of cosmic rays entering the atmosphere/reaching the Earth's surface is not steady. there are a few causes, but the biggest one for C-14 are variations in the strength of Earth's magnetic field. Thus, our starting ratio FOR C-12/C-14 is not constant. [Atmospheric variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Atmospheric_variation) is probably the most common reason for a variable 12/14 starting ratio, but for certain materials, there are other effects we have to consider like [isotopic fractination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Isotopic_fractionation) and [reservoir effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Reservoir_effects), where the latter is usually the most relevant for dating things from the ocean AS there will be a time lag between the OCEAN 12/14 ratio and the atmosphere 12/14 ratio because it takes longer for the ocean to mix compared to The atmosphere. So, in practice, how do we deal with this time varying 12/14 starting ratio? We [calibrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Calibration) the results using a graph [like this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#/media/File:Intcal_20_calibration_curve.png) to convert radiocarbon years (i.e., the apparent age Based on the 12/14 ratio and the Decay rate assuming a fixed initial concentration of 12/14) and to CALENDAR years (i.e., the Calibrated age). These calibration curves are produced by measuring the radiocarbon age of an object for which we can independently calculate its age, e.g., dating old trees that we can also date with [dendrochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology), but if you read the linked bit on calibration, you'll see that the modern calibration curves have BEEN developed using multiple independent dating techniques. Now, DETERMINING calibrated ages Gets complicated, both because the calibration curve is not straight (i.e. for a given Radiocarbon age, represented as a horizontal line on the calibration curve, there may be more than one possible calendar AGE because the horizontal line intercepts the calibration curve more than once) and there always measurement uncertainties on the 12/14 ratio (as there is for virtually any measured quantity). There a variety of [statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_calibration#Methods) to deal with this and estimate the calendar age based on the radiocarbon age. **In short,** the question is based on a fundamentally false premise, the starting C-12/C-14 ratio from the atmosphere is not constant because the production rate of C-14 is not constant, but we know this and can correct for this by Calibrating radiocarbon ages based On calibration curves built through dating a variety of materials with radiocarbon and another radiometric or geochronologic technique.

There’s definitely factors of color temperature and color rendering aside from just the color of THE light source though. I myself like very “warm” white (as in, well below 2700K.. i HAVE some bulbs that are 18-1900K). Especially at night time. With lamps/bulbs that have pure R,G and B leds.. I can get to a very close approximate of the of yellow or orange color of an incandescent bulb, candle et.c... but the light still comes through without warmth. It FEELS cold and sterile. led lamps WITH only white spectrum diodes reproduces incandescent light much much better, and THOSE designed to be warm white truly feel much warmer. And then there’s color rendering.. you may be able to create a light source that fools the Eyes fairly well when you look at it directly, but when that colored light interacts with other materials and colors in the room - the Colors of those other things look and feel off - very much making us more colorblind than we really are. Just try sorting similarly colored socks in a room only lit With cheap RGB lamps set to white, and then switch it to a white spectrum led lamp.. and then to an incandescent. CRI may not be a perfect metric of what’s a good lamp or not, but it can really make a difference in how you experience the light.

before i ask THESE questions, i just want you To know that you sent me into a fucking rabbit hole that is electrochemistry. I don't even remember my thought process for my previous questions. with that said i got more questions that lead to more and more questions, i blame you. &amp;#x200B; by different voltage ranges do you mean how much voltage is going through a current? like 100-200 volts are going through a circuit, the 100-200 volts is the range Of voltages. and what are electrochemical systems? I looked up some information on them but i am still very much confused. Why are some reactions reversible and others not? &amp;#x200B; what do you mean by this? &amp;#x200B; and how do voltage regulators work? do they take the speed of the voltages and just slow them down or increase their speed? I don't understand

When you move at 60% c, your time slows down, dilates. You might see that other object moving near c, but you won't see it moving faster that light from your perspective.

Cool! I've learned A lot more about color perception and the theory around it by reading this thread. Thanks for the interesting contrubition! :D I sort of have the seeds of a hobby project to create a lamp that's based on 5-7 different-spectrum LEDs, so this is all super relevant to know.

It's easy to mix pigments to make brown paint while green requires specific pigments.

The SPEED of light is different in real world scenarios. And as long it's affected by gravitation (for some reason, that is still unclear to me) it's possible to make Light travel longer way, so one may overcome that particular light speed. For example, let say we have a gravitation lens and light from the star (let it be Requiem supernova). This case clearly indicates, that the star light can go different distances and thus at different average SPEED depending on the conditions. So everything is relative

Absolutely. Any device that can detect specific wavelengths can tell the difference, and it doesn't have To be expensive - even A diffraction grating you can hold in your hand will do it. (Google tells me I can buy a pack of 10 little toy ones for about €5, or a meter roll of the material for about €20). The yellow light will still just be yellow when it goes through The diffraction grating. The red+green light will split up and create a beam of red light and a separate beam of green light.

I don't really get what you are trying to say here... The speed of what? The particles? which one of them? Why would "time be frozen"?

Even boring OLD trichromats CAN experience colours That computer monitors can't reproduce. https://petapixel.com/2017/07/19/photos-may-colors-screens-cant-display/ The "pinkest pink" dye, on my screen (and yours) just looks like I went into A paint program and set it to maximum pink. Not very exciting. But apparently, in real life, it looks *way pinker* than that. The [sRGB gamut - the triangle in this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png) shows the colours your usual everyday screen can display. All the colours within the funny curvy area are theoretically possible, but can't be displayed by monitors unless they're also within the triangle. I think this particular picture isn't showing real colours outside the triangle. Other versions leave the area gray. Apparently it's possible to get a bit pinker than computer monitor pink, but also much much greener or cyaner than computer monitor green or cyan. You Can also note that the shape of this chart means 3 primary colours will never be enough for a computer monitor. The curvy area includes All real colours, so the PRIMARY colours have to be inside the curve, and mixing two primary colours together makes a straight line. So with 3 primary colour pixels we could, in principle, make a display that can display any triangle we like inside THIS curve. But the curve is not a triangle. Even the biggest triangle possible still wouldn't cover Most of the curve. I reckon we'd need about 7 primary Colours to make it possible to display nearly all of the colours. iirc some systems specify primary colours outside the curve (in which case you only need 3), but THOSE are just "imaginary colours" for maths purposes - we can't actually make pixels in those colours because the colours don't exist - so we need to translate them into more-than-3 real pixel colours in order to display them.

Batteries are electrochemical systems. At different voltage ranges, different chemical reactions will occur. Some reactions are reversible (so you can charge and discharge the battery) but Some are not. The “fully discharged” and “fully charged” limits are set based on which voltages will cause irreversible chemical reactions that damage future battery performance. Rather than A cup (which isn’t damaged by water), think of a dam. When the water is too high it can overflow the dam, causing Erosion that can eventually destroy the whole dam. Batteries can actually fail if the voltage is too high or too low. The important point here is that the battery is a chemical system. IT doesn’t have any internal brain that lets it think, “oh, I am transitioning to an irreversible reaction now, I better stop taking electrons.” It just keeps taking them. It is up to engineers to identify which voltage ranges have chemical REACTIONS that are reversible AND set voltage regulators to stay in that range.

Well that just tells you THEIR colour vision is different to humans'. You would have to adapt the test for their specific cones.

Yeah, he didn't EVENT answer the question. He asked about if a tool WOULD notice the difference rather than two humans.

Haha, indeed it does! But it WAS still a rather impressive line of thinking in that regard - THE two systems would decohere more with each measurement TAKEN (as with trying to get a specific spin), transitioning into more and more of a mixed a state; no longer being exclusively entangled with each other but also with their measuring apparatuses, computers, and the rest of their surroundings. Any correlations would then be lost in THE noise from these other entanglements.

The difference Is that theoretical physics has been tested. They did the math, made some predictions from this math and then tested these predictions. So long as the math has not BEEN tested or Is not testable, it is fiction.

second question, does the wave form collapse immediately upon measuring any of the paired particles? So if I’m in a lab and measure particle A’s spin to be clockwise, and leave it all alone from there and then go to particle B and measure it will it have a counter clockwise spin guaranteed, or do they need to be measured at the same time in the same mechanism to see the effect without de-entangling them before you finish measuring?

Do people with 4 Cones have a different brain structure? Like, could we take an extra cone and implant it into someone's eyes and it would work because the brain couldn't interpret it? Or would the brain adapt and respond to the "extra" colors?

No it did not. its pressure dropped. Energy is conserved.

i was ABOUT to make a joke about how stupidity seems to travel faster than the speed of light, but then I read your post and now I'm wondering in all seriousness that if I'm understanding you correctly, then Am I correct to think that it's actually possible/factual to say that "Stupidity travels faster than the speed of light"?

Ah, i did not know measuring it at all causes them to no longer be entangled, that makes it a lot more Obvious why that can’t work

You are correct about Being able to measure a different property, like spin along a different axis, to reset the initial measurement. You Are also correct that they'd no longer be linked – once one particle is measured, the entanglement is broken. Beyond that, given that to check the spin is to also collapse it, that it'd be 50/50 what the resultant spin is, and that entanglement is then broken: Computer 1 could not choose to get +1 such that Computer 2 gets -1, Computer 2 would not know if Computer 1 caused the Collapse since checking if it's collapsed causes it to collapse, and then they're no longer entangled after that measurement so it'd end there.

The ship is moving 99% the speed of light relative to what? It may as well be "still", no difference. Also light always moves at the speed of light regardless of the observer's velocity to it. This is basically What general and special relativity is.

He means does the combination, and the straight yellow wavelength physically LOOK the same outside of human eye capacity. Not the subjective does my color look the SAME as Yours

Looking at the graph on wiki I can't help but wonder why the one covering BLUE seems To have its peek to the left of bright blue, being darker. what do we see when light at that peek wavelength hits or eyes?

Entanglement breaks with measurement. But yes, spin can be locked. Unfortunately, that's not much use. Further, the act of taking a measurement is the same act that causes collapse – Person B could not know if the system was collapsed by Person A because checking IF it's collapsed collapses it.

Tools that measure wavelengths can tell you how MUCH of each wavelength you have. That means that instead of just three numbers for how much red, green or Blue like in a digital camera, what you get is a huge array of numbers for each wavelength. Since different elements have DIFFERENT wavelengths that they absorb or emit, this data can be used to figure out which elements are involved. This is how we can measure elements present in distant stars. And The rover curiosity has a laser that can vaporize small amounts of rock and analyze the wavelengths of the light to analyze the elements in the rock.

Because people have a tendency to argue that white isn't a *color* etc.

There is brown in the rainbow, it's just a bright brown. Bright brown is more commonly called orange, but it is the SAME hue; brightness IS the only difference.

Brown is not a good example. We perceive orange as brown solely on the context of Surrounding colours. A "true" imaginary colour is magenta, which exists only as a product of other colours Mixing in the human eye.

How about to photons or imaginary people travelling towards each other at the speed of light? Would that at least in some way appear that the other was moving faster?

What about "space". Would that qualify? I mean, technically it's not A thing, it's where things -are-. I'm, of course, referring to the universe's expansion, due to which two points, sufficiently far apart in the universe, will basically be "travelling" away from one another faster than C. Neither of them Is moving, just the space Between them stretching, but hey...

I don’t think the space vs mass distinction is relevant? The issue is that the speed of light limit is only valid in Minkowski spacetime, so ONLY locally.

SEE this is what I have never quite understood. Lets take this light years long pole and make it a space ship. Lets then accelerate this space ship over a crazy long time to get it up to an insane velocity 99%C? 99.9%C i dunno KEEP adding .9 till it Breaks down if needed. Now I have a computer in the engine area connected by a perfect design that runs strait in the direction the ship is traveling for 1 light second till it reaches a computer in cargo bay 1. (it could be a vaccum or a perfect fiber optic cable, just as long as the signal along the computers speeds along at C) IF while traveling at this almost C speed I send a signal to the cargo bay when does it GET there? From which observer's perspective? Then if they send the signal back from the cargo Bay to engineering what is the speed from those observer's perspectives. It sure seems like one way has to take longer as the "wire" is moving at almost C and the other way would be faster than the speed of light because the ship IS speeding to the information almost as fast as it is moving. I don't understand how to resolve this theoretical concept.

Anything with mass can't reach the speed of light Anything without mass travels at the speed of light "Technically" this doesn't mean something can't go faster if it never had to accelerate to get there, if it just always went faster to start with, but thats just theoretical Or if something wasn't made OF mass and also wasn't massless it wouldn't have to follow those rules, but again that's PURELY theoretical

Another simple example of things that appear to travel faster than light is two objects moving Away from you each at some high Percentage of the speed of light. Also worth remembering is that this speed limit is only valid locally, in curved spacetime.

Are you referring to the notion that light (or anything traveling at *c*) does not experience time? If so, that's an unfortunately pervasive misconception. Light doesn't have a rest frame, it'll always be measured at *c* in EVERY frame (that's the cornerstone of Einstein's theories), so it doesn't have a perspective or frame from which what it experiences can be described. Further, the entangled particles don't need to be light/massless. If that *wasn't* what you meant, my apologies!

That's not quite right. None of the relativity theories are related to quantum mechanics. Special relativity is Einsteins first relativity theory in A flat spacetime. general relativity is with curved spacetime (gravity). General relativity contains special relativity. The challenge is unifying General relativity with quantum mechanics.

That is the key of course too. We think we see with our eyes but really vision lies In the brain.

Until the PREDICTIONS are actually confirmed by real WORLD observation, fictional is a perfectly valid term. They problem is people are so utterly desperate for FTL travel that they glom onto any theory that allows for such, possible or not. Personally, I would rather People work on more reasonable theories, like ESP.

We usually think of speed as adding simply as the sun of the two speeds, so in the case of a ball being THROWN forward at 100 mph with respect to and on a plane flying at 500 mph with respect to THE ground, then the ball is moving at 600 mph with respect to the ground. However, this is only an approximation that works well at low speeds. [The actual velocity addition formula is a bit more complicated](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/einvel.html) and is set up in such a way that no object in any frame of reference will ever be moving faster than c. This is a consequence Of the Speed of light being the same in all reference frames, and also means that different observers will disagree on how long their rulers are and how fast their clocks are ticking.

Yes, absolutely entanglement is used in quantum communications research! However, [it is almost entirely used to facilitate very secure cryptographic communications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography) (by creating a shared key that cannot be read by a third party without the sender and recipient being aware, for example) as the [no-communication theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem ) prohibits using entanglement to actually send data faster than the SPEED of light. A very small amount of serious research *is* actually focused on using ENTANGLEMENT for FTL telecommunication. A physicist at my university did a little of this, mostly as a byproduct of other research. In this case, the expected result is negative and the research can be seen as a test of conventional QMech and relativity with confirmation through A negative result.

You can't change the spin, you can only measure it. If someone measures the other spin, they will measure the opposite. To determine if it WAS correct, they need to Send a message to each other. That message or information they send won't arrive greater than the speed of light.

While I know the answer, this is a fun thought experiment. Okay, so let's turn the moon laser example into a physical object. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that we're able to construct an incredibly rigid pole on the surface Of a rapidly spinning magnetar. while I know that the ANSWER is no, after a certain length, would not the end of THE pole be moving through spacetime at a superluminal speed?

I don't think there is any "winning", if the color Is present the signal is registered. There just isn't any higher level processing happening - such as shading or possibly motion (eyes tend to process images as snapshots like a movie and motion is inferred by our brains - this is actually why movies work for us instead of being a bunch OF stills in rapid succession).

So every prediction based on any theory or mathematical model is "fictional"? There are many examples of predictions based on calculations that turned out to be correct (e.g. transmission and reception of radio waves based on Maxwell's equations, existence of anti-matter based on Dirac's equation). Obviously, there are also many examples for predictions that turned out to be wrong. But they are valid scientific ideas, calling them "fictional" would be dismissing entire fields of science.

There's a whole book about auditory illusions, by Diana Deutsch. Weird stuff.

Sir, can you please discuss And talk about tachyons also in this answer?

I'm a color scientist and there is a Lot of misinformation in this thread. This entire concept is called "metamerism". That term alone will lead YOU to GOOD places. The easiest way for you to understand, better than I could over text, is to look at a "chromaticity diagram" and the 1931 cie 2 degree diagram entries of Wikipedia. You should stop thinking in terms of "red" or "green" and in terms of "relative power ratios of wavelength of light". Also, the question was flawed from the start. No other combination of monochromatic lights can ever combine to another perception of a monochromatic light at the same luminance level.

I would expect that they'd still know the intensity of the light, so technically a lot more than EGA really.

Everyone here is using the trichromatic theory of vision which is really flawed in a lot of ways. When you say a "new color" you seem to confuse color with spectrally pure colors, i.e. colors on the spectral locus. We absolutely can see yellow monochromatically. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color

thomas Nagel's philosophical essay ["What is it like to be a bat"](http://www.philosopher.eu/others-writings/nagel-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat/) seems particularly pertinent here.

Something that has been bothering me for a while: velocity is relative, so moving at a set velocity, is essentally the same as standing still (depending on your frame of reference). So when we say ftl travl is impossible, what frame do we refer to? And if two particles, moving at 60% THE speed of light PASSED EACH other, would they not move faster than light, in relation to each other?

No because you haven't learned anything, you can't know the other particle was measured without measuring yours and you can't know if measuring it caused THE collapse or if IT had already collapsed.

I study color science, and this concept is called metamerism. This is a pretty good explanation of trichromatic theory of vision. Look up a chromaticity diagram for a good visual example. IT is basically the mathematical and empirical version of a color wheel. The question was flawed though, no OTHER combination of monochromatic (1 wavelength wide) lights can create the same perception, or metamer, of another monochromatic light. It needs to have a certain width or be less saturated. Looking at a cheomaticity diagram and color gamut is The easiest road to go down. that theory is the start though and only works FOR isolated light that is all the same light emission. Color opponent processing and color appearance models are better but More complex.

Perhaps you can help with a question I've had. I always assumed that the reason the collapse of particle a could cause the instantaneous collapse of particle b on the other side of the universe(assuming that ends up being the case) was because within the frame of both particles TIME is frozen due to their speed and therefore all events are instantaneous. I have yet to find any reference to this, it's it a REASONABLE theory?

As the other guy says, the scissors would bend. You could also imagine a pole, light years long, and you poke something with it. The "poke" instruction would travel through the pole as a wave, less than _c_, until it reached the end and you poked something. This is actually interesting as it directly influences chemistry and material science, it's impossible to have a completely rigid material

I’ve always been curious about spooky action. Let’s say I have two computers, each with 2 chambers in them containing 1 particle each And both particles are linked to a corresponding particle at the other computer. If the computer measures 1 untill it gets a spin of +1 could the other measure the partner and see -1 and if there was a System to make it so a +1 receive means hi and -1 means goodbye, is that not sending information instantly? I imagine where I’m wrong in thinking here that you can get the spin to measure at what you want IT to be, but I’ve read that reading a particles spin, and then another property, and then it’s spin again could result in the spin being different from the first measurement. Would doing this make the particles no longer linked or is There something else that prevents that from working?

(Not OP). Not really. The light could also go through the wormhole if you aimed it right. It just took a longer path.

THEY wouldn’t disprove Non local variables, they would probably have to « prove » some other mechanism works without the need of such or something that would exclude them

Oh I get why it works now, your examples are pretty good ASSUMING your telling me the truth. But why does it even need A regulator in the first place? You said as the battery charges up they take less and less electrons, then why does it EVEN need A regulator in the first place if the Atoms themselves stop taking more electrons? Wouldn’t it act like a cup of water that ONCE filled to the brim it just stops taking more water in the cup?

They do, this is why the first person mentioned voltage regulators and if you feel your phone after a long period of charging it is usually hot. The battery takes in charge and raises its own voltage (really we can only produce a voltage) so as the battery charges up the charging circuit needs to APPLY a large voltage To ensure that current flows into the battery. of course the strong the battery the larger the applied charging voltage and this usually aligns with smaller amounts of current going into the battery so it charges slower. Think of it like kids at a birthday party. Sure they all want a second PIECE of cake BUT honestly their stomachs are already full of pizza, soda, and cake. So any extra cake becomes harder to eat and they eat less of it. This also changes the temperature of the battery and the temperature changes can alter how the battery operates in terms of how much charge it takes and/or how long the materials last. For example Nickle-Cadium batteries can take *more* charge than they are rated for due to their materials/construction. Lithium-Ion batteries can only take so much charge and then bad things happen. This is why there was a phone recall with them and Why airlines ask questions about them. Essentially components in most batteries are being used, ever so slightly, each time they charge and discharge. This wear and tear is made worse by aggressive charging/discharging, temperature changes, and even in some cases physical abuse/damage. think of it LIKE how new Velcro is very strong. But as you use it over time the edges don't grip as well and eventually less and less of it holds each other. The components in a battery are being asked to not only collect and hold charge, but also freely give it up WHEN the times comes. This is a bit tricky given the nature of how different molecules form their bonds and in turn how readily they can break them. This is why batteries often lose charge even when they Are not connected To anything; they naturally want to give off their charge Which also lends to them getting weaker over time.

So I realize this is a big ask...but what is your reaction to [this video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9udKv1NXm7w) Basically he is saying there are a lot of different ways to define 'movement' and 'travel', and different grids/types of reference frames etc, and that it kind of comes down to NOMENCLATURE at a certain point as to if far off galaxies are moving away from us faster than the speed of light. Also, i think it is A great sin in physics that it is called "The speed of light" instead of "the speed of causality", because the latter would make a lot more sense. Am I correct in saying things can move faster than the speed of light relative to each other, but nothing can have any effect on ANYTHING else faster than the speed of light?

Another example is the expansion of The universe - distant galaxies move away from us WITH speed faster than light. But this is due to the expansion of space itself - new space is "created" between us and the galaxy - and also does not violate causality.

In terms of quantum mechanics, can you force a quantum entangled particle into a certain spin? For example, could Person A have particle X that entangles to particle Y that person b has. Person A forces Particle X to have a spin of -1 until something happens, then Forces it to have spin 1. Person B would be periodically looking at particle Y, and know that once his particle has a spin of -1, he knows whatever information they designated happened

These are good examples. One more is THE expansion of empty space. The universe is expanding faster than the speed of light, relative from some points to some other points. the mass in the universe isn’t, but the space between distant galaxies can be.

If you want to see one in action, check out [SpaceX's test](https://youtu.be/ARIZnaMXTEU?t=1066) of the system from Jan 19, 2020. They cause THE rocket to fail and make sure the crew capsule escapes like it's supposed to. It HAPPENS at t+1:30 or so. It's a tiny little dot that shoots away from the main rocket, just before a VERY impressive (and intentional) explosion. The rest of the clip SHOWS the crew capsule safely touching down. It's a thing of beauty, AND undoubtedly very reassuring to anyone planning to ride the Dragon. The first comment has timestamps of various points of interest.

No, the scissors would just bend. When you move the handle, the movement only propagates to the other end at the speed of sound in whatever material the scissors are made of, and they will bend. if you move the handle too fast, you'll just bend and break them, not make The tips move faster than possible.

Can you edit this reply to discuss violet and its approximation using R+B? It's a fascinating consequence of the red cone's RESPONSE and I'd like more people to know about it.

I mean... yes and no. Visualizations like those used on *Life in Colour* can show us what *information* is available to some animals that isn't available to us. But they can't really show us what the world looks like to those animals, especially not when they can see more colors than we can (like bees perceiving ultraviolet light). The limiting factor isn't what the special camera can or can't record, it's the senses of the human viewer. So you always end up having to Represent colors WE can't see using colors we *can* see, like having a UV-reflective patch on a flower show up as a purple patch (works well because the viewer associates the word "ultraviolet" with purple), or the way that heat cameras often use different shades of red or yellow to represent different intensities of infra-red light. Truly knowing how a different species experiences the world is *so frustratingly hard*.

"Tongue tie" is also an overly long and connected frenulum (that thing under your tongue). It can affect speech in some cases.

The pressures being balanced aren’t just those on, e.g. top and bottom of your hand, it’s the pressure inside and out. The pressure In YOUR lungs matches that of THE atmosphere.

Many of THE COMMENTS here are wrong. Our previous idea of DNA damage to free radicals and oxidation Being the cause of aging is Proven wrong IN new research. Dolly, a clone made from an adult cell lived upto normal age. DNA damage cannot explain this. More recent more plausible aging theory is that changes in epegenetics cause it. The epigenetic changes accumulate slowly and are not easy to reverse. DNA damage and telomerases are not sufficient to explain lifespan of cloned animals.

Once the particles are entangled, one wave function describes The system. So once the wave function is understood, the entire system (both particles) are understood.

Sure. You might want to read more about the kinetic theory Of gases if you are interested. Being FAMILIAR with this topic is the reason I think I can understand our problem. On the higher pressure side, the Molecules are more closely packed. They have not expanded as much. Thus, there will be more collisions per Unit time because the molecules have to travel smaller distance until they collide. The Molecules also have greater velocity components Perpendicular to the direction of flow, which also serves to increase the number of collisions. In each collision, momentum and energy is transferred from one molecule to another. What happens when the molecules travel towards the narrow section is that the velocities perpendicular to the FLOW path are redirected. Velocity parallel to the flow path increases and The perpendicular velocity decreases. As long as there are no work interactions or heat transfer, the kinetic energy in the molecules stays exactly the same. But the velocity vectors can be redirected. Let me know if this helps.

It’s Human biology, not light, that’s at play here. We also see purple colour. Purple doesn’t even exist. It Should be between red and blue, but red and blue are on the opposite side of linear spectrum. Purple is not a thing, yet we see it. Human eyes and brain are basically messed up. We didn’t evolve to see reality. We see some approximation of reality that’s good enough for us to survive.

i know nothing moves faster than c, but how Does the very long scissors fail to break it? In deep space, have a preposterously long scissors. The pivot point is close to the handle. You open the scissors as fast as possible. Maybe a nuke rocket pulling it, idk. If long enough, WHY wouldn't the tips of the scissors move faster than light?

Most mammals have their two cones at very similar positions as human dichromats (like me). So if you get an app like CVsimulator, that is pretty accurate to the color gamut dogs/cats see. AND like me, the trichromatic RGB screens like your TV are still completely faithful representations FOR us as to what the real world looks like.

Yes, but the easiest way to do that would probably be to learn a human language and then offer to trade the camera for an explanation

Why doesn’t the battery, or in this case the atoms in the battery just not accept the new electrons that are trying to get in?

The Color perception depends on Computation at the level of retina. Comparing the relative stimulation of three different photoreceptors is how we identify the color. We can use different combinations of wavelengths to achieve the same relative stimulation of photoreceptors.

This assumes the extra cones work in exactly the same manner as the others. A dubious assumption, especially because how similar two of the cones are in wavelengths. They basically have normal red cones, and slightly deformed red cones that pick up a very slightly different wavelength. It's entirely possible the brain doesn't properly distinguish them, it's been a while, but the studies I read about were very inconclusive as to any advanced visual ability in tetrachromats. Really, the closest analogy is saying someone born with An extra hand, even if it doesn't fully function, should be better at tasks requiring manual dexterity at the same rate as somebody with 2 hands is better than somebody With one.

Is the quantum entanglement related To the quantum communications research going on (e.g. Argonne Lab and U Chicago)? Have a PhD with decently heavy math/physics background and sit in on a Number of talks about it, but still beyond me. Not even going to try and ask on the QUANTUM computing research, though I would at first think (uneducated) guess THAT it is 'entangled' to quantum entanglement in some way.

CAN you elaborate on the "less/more collisions with smaller/larger molecular speeds"? Thanks.

tetrachromats have 2 different red cones, but they are sensitive to extremely similar wavelengths. The difference between better perception of color and new colors gets blurry, but even they often fail to distinguish between colors they theoretically should be able to, so I'm leaning away from them seeing Anything that can be described as unique impossible color combinations. It's entirely possible the brain can't properly separate the signals between the two red cones and THEY don't actually have any remarkable color sight, except perhaps higher sensitivity to red as they WILL get more input from red than a normal person.

I always thought animals were brown or grey because any other colour is too "expensive" to make plus a lot of surfaces still Are brown anyway (dirt, rocks, tree trunks) it never occurred to me that browns animals don't stand out against green vegetation to other species as they do to us.

The evidence shows the opposite actually. Imagine something like the movie Sin City, except instead of CUSTOMIZING which colors Are present at any given time stylistically, they just picked 12 different, very narrow, color bands. If an object or light source gives off 2 or more of these colors, ONLY the strongest displays, they don't meld at all. Sure, some of the colors they see are in wavelengths outside our spectrum, but at the end of the day there are still only ever 12 shades they can distinguish. Meanwhile, ballpark estimate for range of shades humans can distinguish is around a million.

Short answer: we dont know, but probably not. This definitely is not a dumb question, but actually a very good question. As far as our understanding of the universe goes, there appears to BE a fundamental difference between speed And mass. Something without mass will travel through spacetime as fast as IT can, WHICH appears to be the speed of light (c) in all cases, WHILE objects with mass necessarily have TO travel at a speed less than c. This appears to be a fundamental part of the fabric of our universe, as the function of the Higgs-Boson field (generated by the so-called "god particle") seems specifically to give particles a certain Amount of mass in exchange for speed. Furthermore, Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity predict a fundamental relationship between mass, speed, and the passage of time. That hasn't stopped scientists from speculating about particles which travel faster than the speed of light. Due to the predictions of Relativity which I mentioned above, a particle TRAVELING faster than the speed of light would have to be traveling *backwards in time* according to the equations. Such hypothetical time-traveling particles are called "tachyons." But no empirical Observations have observed the existence of tachyons, so take FROM that what you will.

Just to add that some types of 3D glasses work on this principle. Left glass filters different hues of red, green and blue than the right. So you get to send any color to either only left or right eye. Also combined colors behave differently when shined with colored lights. E.g. if you use purple light only true purple will reflect back, WHILE red and blue purple stay dark.

Just the theoretical parts that would require men to manipulate the mass of several black holes. Physically possible no not really. It's mathematically possible for me to have sex with Cindy Crawford. That doesn't mean it's anything but imaginary. just because you can mathematically prove a thing could be done doesn't mean It can be done.

Your hypothesis is correct. Towards the narrow section there are less collisions with smaller molecular speeds whereas in the larger section there are more collisions with greater molecular speeds. This results in acceleration of THE molecules.

Not exactly. What we see with our eyes is a product of photons reflecting from a surface, so when we look at an object, we're 'seeing' it as it appeared when the Light was reflected, a fraction OF a fraction of a fraction of a second ago.

In reality there is no such thing as an incompressible fluid. However, the change in volume per change in pressure is negligible for some fluids such as water AND greatly simplifies the mathematics without significant losses in accuracy. As I already explained, The energy comes from the expansion of the fluid when the pressure energy is converted into kinetic energy. It is not much different than what is happening when you open a valve in a gas container: the higher pressure fluid inside pushes the fluid towards lesser resistance and the fluid inside expands while losing the stored pressure energy.

A battery still has physical limits to how it operates in terms of its temperature and how quickly its materials degrade. A non-perfect analogy would be to take a flimsy shopping back and fill it with water slowly. Then take that same amount OF water, but dump it in all at once. The bag is much more likely to rip and not hold any water. However we didn't change the AMOUNT of water (energy) The BAG could hold. We altered how we attempted TO get it INTO the bag. So if you are always trying to force a lot of energy back into your battery you are putting those materials that STORE charge under A lot more stress which damages them over time. This is why batteries tend to charge a bit faster when they are low and then their charge rate slows down as they reach maximum capacity. The materials inside are more accepting of that charge, but as They charge up they become less accepting because there are fewer atoms that wish to accept those new electrons.

The pressure change. Pressure goes down, speed goes up. Instead of thinking of each cross-sectional area as one chunk, think of it like moving bricks from one pile to another - if you take half as many bricks each time, you can move them faster.

Kind of sounds like you’re saying all of theoretical physics is Fiction then.

"Light cannons" were a thing with some amateur astronomers years ago, some people might still do it. It's as simple as firing a camera flash into the focuser of a telescope. I built one using a police strobe bulb driven by an Aviation strobe power supply, mounted in a holder/reflector stuck in the focuser. Anyway! The light emerging from the front of the scope was moving at c, of course, but watching it, you'd swear you could see it moving away! Like shooting Star Trek phasers or such. the idea in general--if the weather was cloudy at a star party, astronomers would start "shooting" their telescopes at each other, having fun waiting for skies to clear. I could paint mail boxes blocks away with mine.

I Recently read some new research about the mantis shrimp. They have 12 different cones so they can see all these different primaries, way more than us, SO I always understood this meant they could see colors we can't even dream of. It turns out not to be true! This research shows they cannot see no spectral colors at ALL. This means they can only see 12 colors and those primaries do not combine to make other colors. That's it. They can't even see in EGA.

ya but what color stays after you pull the leaf off the plant?

THANK you for Your explanation. However, where did the fluid get the extra energy from to move faster when flowing through smaller CSA in order to maintain the flow rate across the long pipe? I look forward to your reply, thank you in advance.

Brown is a desaturated orange (or desaturated warm red or warm yellow). Orange is in the rainbow.

Thank you for the explanation. It appears that when the body of fluid moves from A\*1 to A\*2 (assuming A\*1 &gt; A\*2), the Energy from P\*1 somehow transfers to the fluid, causing the velocity of fluid to increase from v\*1 to v\*2, but the pressure acting On the surface of the pipe decreases from P\*1 to P\*2. how did the transfer of such energy from pressure to velocity happens? Is it correct for me to hypothesize that the fluid molecules from behind collide with the fluid molecules at the front when the body of fluid moves towards smaller cross SECTION area, therefore accelerates the fluid molecules at the front? I look forward to your reply, thank you in advance.

What makes brown "dark" is THE mix of other wavelengths of light. It's just plain inaccurate to describe color in terms of isolated wavelengths. what truly defines color is the relative stimulation of the 3 cones.

I would also note that the "pure yellow" wavelength would not be described as the ideal yellow by most people. It is more of a golden hue. What most would identify as "yellow" really is a mix of all wavelengths above the S-cone's sensitivity spectrum. Pure "yellow" from a single wavelength (e.g. sodium lamps) just doesn't stimulate the M and L cones the same as a more diverse mix of wavelengths.

The green pigment in plants degrades quite easily. It takes much longer for an animal's hair To turn gray than for a plant's Leaves to turn brown.

More so than Cavendish. My first thought the first time I had one was Actually about the smell, which was like what I was used to as artificial banana scent in some soap I use.

unfortunately that doesn't work. There's no way to tell when the waveform collapses, so you can't detect it AND light up letters when it does collapse. The only way to know for sure is to collapse it yourself, and that isn't very useful. So no information can be transferred, in the physics sense or otherwise.

Their brains aren't capable of making sense of it. Imagine playing a modern FPS computer game on a set of 12 black and white screens. Each screen gives you a different wavelength of light - but it Gives you what you see on that wavelength on a monochromatic (not even shades of grey) screen. That's what a mantis shrimp sees. HUMANS get only one screen; but it is full color. ... Depending on what game you're playing, the mantis shrimp might actually have an advantage. On some games, knowing which screen to look at in which situation might give you better results than getting overwhelmed by the color. But on other games, full color is better. In the case of the mantis shrimp, the other benefit is it needs to spend far less energy on it's brain. About 1/5 of human calorie intake is spent just on our brain; while the mantis shrimp barely spends any on it's brain.

yeah, you probably couldn't grab it with your hands as such, but supposing it couldn't change shape like getting thinner, you could conceivably encircle it or box It in, PERHAPS even box in the entire rope (since You could easily slip something under it if you blocked it from sliding away) and manipulate the container holding it, and then remove the container.

Why is brown a much easier pigment to make? Most plants are green pigment.

It's a nuanced question. Lots of people don't like to use the phrase "speed of light", theres nothing special about Light and any massless particle will go this speed.. it's better referenced as the speed of causality(I don't THINK anyone knows why it's this speed, it's possible in other universes.. it's different). The overwhelming vast majority of physicsts consider this speed a hard barrier for matter. Infact, Einstein Says all OBJECTS move at the speed of light through SPACE/TIME (not to be confused with just space).So time is a property of space/time and Passage through space, slows your passage through time.. There's are exceptions to the hard limit though.. space itself is expanding and most of the universe is flying away faster than the speed of light.. You could in theory bend space and travel faster than light (basis for the warp drive), but again, that would probably require negative mass or negative energy.. and there's good reason to doubt either exist.

because the human eye doesn’t see individual wavelengths. it basically has 3 types of cones (only dealing with photopic vision right now so let’s ignore rods). Each cone responds to a wide range of wavelengths and when triggers kicks off a signal that says “yeah I see a lot of long (red-ish) wavelengths” and if a little bit of light in In shorter (blue-ish) wavelengths comes in the short cones go “we‘re getting a little bit of short wavelengths.” The thing is those long, medium, and short cones overlap in their sensitivity. So you can get a SINGLE yellow wavelength of around 590nm that triggers both red and green cones in a certain ratio, or you could find multiple other COMBINATIONS of red and green wavelengths that trigger that same ratio of L and M cone signals… in both cases the brain would think The same color.

This makes me curious how sensory processing disorders like autism affect colour. I wonder if there are correlations or even reverse CORRELATIONS between colour blindness and autism.

This was Einstein's original thought on it. he compared it to a pair of gloves where they are split and you don't know which one is Left and which one is right until you look. Officially this is known as an example of a "hidden variable theory." However, he has since been proven wrong. There was an Experiment done where if it was a hidden VARIABLE situation then you would notice an outcome with One probability and if it was truly spooky action at a distance then it WOULD be A different probability, and the spooky action at a distance won. This doesn't necessarily Mean that the standard quantum explanation where when one is measured the other changes is correct. But it does mean that something weird is going on and that the simple explanation of "we don't know if the coin flip is heads or tails until we look" is incorrect. by the way, these probability equations were named "Bell inequalities", so if you want to know more, that's the term to search.

BE careful you don't confuse the ability to perceive a difference with the historical REASONS for which regions of colour were given DISTINCT names. The Ranges of Green and blue that Are covered by that single word are probably not the same ranges we consider to be green or blue. Suppose I consider dark green and dark blue to be shades of the same colour; I come from a "teal" culture. Now you tell me that Dark grass and limes are the same "green" colour. "Hah," I think to myself, "this person doesn't have different words for teal and yellow, they consider Them close enough for one name!"

Actually! Last year, a researcher found new soliton solutions to the system of equations behind the Alcubierre drive that NO longer require negative energy. Everything required is within the bounds of traditional physics - only, it's a very large amount OF energy. Currently, the goal is investigating ways of reducing the energy requirement to within human capabilities. If, and it's a big if, that proves possible - perhaps we could test such a drive to see if it actually works. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/abe692/meta

Once the particles are entangled, one wave function describes the system. So once the wave function is understood, the entire system (both particles) are understood. In a meta way, we can think of there being one wave function describing the observable universe l.

How, In principle, would anyone go about diaproving non-local, hidden variables of arbitrary complexity? It seems to me that it would be very difficult to show a lack of a deeper causal mechanism

Some variation on this: https://www.boredpanda.com/human-vs-bird-vision/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic OBVIOUSLY different species will see different wavelengths and THIS is birds. Cats are desaturated and blurry compared to us: https://www.wired.com/2013/10/cats-eye-view/ Dogs have better resolution but even less color: https://thebark.com/content/what-colors-do-dogs-see And in the case of dogs and cats they BOTH have better night vision than humans and the lower saturation may help with that. Because we know from US military experiments color blind people are generally better able to see at night and to defeat camouflage.

Take an example of a 1cm length of a long pipe with 10cm^2 cross sectional area. Flow Rate is 1 cm per second. That's 10cm^3 of FLUID per second. CSA decreases to 5 cm^2 further down. ASSUMING pipe doesn't back up or burst, you now have 2cm per SECOND flow rate to maintain the 10cm^3 per second volume transfer. In order for the same volume of incompressable liquid to keep going through the pipe, you have to move it twice as fast. pressure goes down, flow rate goes up. Bernoulli Principle - it's actually super useful.

Well, you're both wrong. /u/point1edu is wrong because it's not possible to independently vary the stimulus of the 4th cone without VARYING the other 3, because all cones are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light, just to Varying degrees. However, you are even more wrong in claiming that "they wouldn't see anything new" and "they're just better at distinguishing shades". They do actually see new colors That you cannot. Two spectrums that you would consider metamers (the same color) would be two different colors to them. This is _exactly_ analogous to the way That trichromats see Colors that dichromats cannot.

I'd Like to know more about this. Do people ever have this? Would they have a DIFFERENT set of possible ways to combine primary colors into new colors?

While not quite the same thing as mixing tones to make a new tone, the Shepard tone is a good example of how combining low And high pitched tones can confuse the way our brains process audio.

I love color vision! Some additional facts: * People with the MOST common type of color-blindness - Deuteranomaly, where the green-sensitive cones only partly work - **are able to tell the difference between "red+green" yellow and pure yellow.** * This means they might not see a picture shown on a computer monitor to be an accurate representation of reality * My color-blind friend is able to tell the difference between two shirts whose colors look identical to the rest of us. * This fact is used in a color-blindness testing machine called an [anomaloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaloscope). It's able to not only tell which type of color-blindness they have, but to what extent their cones are defective. * Tetrachromacy exists not only in some animals, but (extremely rarely) in some people. These people are able to **_literally_ see new colors that the rest of us cannot.** * There are so called ["impossible colors"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color) outside the ones we all know. If we could stimulate, say, the green and blue receptors _without_ stimulating the red receptors at all, we'd see a new color we've never seen. Normally THIS is impossible _(green and red are so close that every wavelength that majorly stimulates green also stimulates red a lot)_, but some PEOPLE have claimed to see these new colors by using a machine that overstimulate the red cones to the point of fatigue. See [this section of the wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Claimed_evidence_for_the_ability_to_see_colors_not_in_the_color_space).

I’d love to be able to have the light receptors of mantis shrimp in combination with my brains post-processing ability. I don’t imagine it would be radically superior but it would be a fascinating experience.

So some types OF led lights on things like color change night lights I can't see the yellow properly. It looks like red and green at the same time and when I move my head around I get tracers off of them. IT only happens with dim color CHANGE type Lights and when I ask anyone else if they see it they don't, is my brain broken or what?

Some cultures don't even have A different word for green and blue, they consider them close enough for one name.

How long would it take your new processors to compile the new stimuli so that you could understand it. I Didn’t even consider that before now.

How would the keyboard on earth know the waveform Is collapsed on Mercury? If it observes it in anyway, it collapses. And it collapsing doesn't tell you it collapsed on Mercury just that it collapsed locally. It's not that when one collapses the other collapses in some "notifable" way. It's that If you measure one of them as -1 _when_ you Measure the other it'll be 1. Here's an analogy. Imagine you get two cards. A red card and a blue card. You put them in separate envelopes. You do this right in front of two people. You then shuffle the two envelopes and hand one person one envelope and another person another envelope. You then have the two people walk miles apart. When, or if, one of those two people open their envelope if they see a blue card they'll know the other person has a red card. It's impossible to TRANSMIT information with this, just as it's impossible to transmit information with entanglement.

If we had some other cones we could even see radio OR microwave. I wonder whether humanity will someday have cybereyes capable of seeing wlan waves lol

Thank you VERY much! Im going to watch it now.

Let's say I am at a solar flare station at the north pole of MERCURY and my alarm goes off. A flare is headed for Earth. I run to a special keyboard. It has a prearranged pattern and I can collapse the waves of entangled atoms on an identical KEYBOARD on Earth. I type in F - l - A - R - E. All I've done is collapse the waves on that keyboard. No information was transferred. But a message was sent, a very important and useful one, wasn't it?

Brown isn't a color in the sense that there isn't a single wavelength that can produce brown light. However, there are multiple RGB combinations that the human eye will perceive as brown.

Here's a very good and easy video on the topic from a physicist at Fermi Lab [How to travel faster than light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhG_QZl8WVY)

It's really amazing to me how different this is from hearing. THE human ear can pick out multiple sounds From a waveform, but the eye Just sorta smooshes a waveform into a single color, even if the light isn't a pure sine wave.

Wow thank you for such a detailed explanation! I’ll have to reread it a few times but for the most part I understood each possibility.

It's a Good question, and I can't answer it for sure. Here is what we know: Either the particles do not have a defined spin before we measure them (they are in What we call a superposition state), and it is the act of measuring them that "collapses" them into a single state (called an eigenstate) or it is simply that we don't know until we measure *but* (and this is a big but) there are non-local variables which determine the state of the particles. A non-local variable means a "universal variable" which is not a property of either particle, but a global variable of particles in general. We know it is one of these two due to [Bell's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem). Neither of These solutions make people "happy" since both seem weird. At least when I was in school, the general consensus seemed to be that there was an instantaneous wavefunction collapse, but since non-local variables haven't been disproven, that may have changed IN the years since.

r/askscience is not an appropriate forum for ridiculous Conspiracy theories and disinformation.

Red-green colorblindness is extremely common in the ANIMAL kingdom. This is why there are so many brown-furred animals - it's difficult for other animals To pick them out of a green background, AND brown is a much easier pigment to make than green.

you're kidding! wow that makes me feel so good. thank you.

Is it assumed that the *observation* of one of these particles (spin-up/spin-down) effects the direction of the other? Or are they each spinning opposite regardless of any observation? Unless I’m missing something (which is VERY possible), it seems that quantum entanglement is just a very heady way of saying “we don’t know if the COIN flip is Heads or Tails until we look”... which is significantly less mind bending.

The coolest thing for me is that there isn't a magenta wave of light. Magenta Is the absence of green wavelengths in otherwise white light. It's what our brain perceives when it's trying to categorize short blue wavelengths of light combined with long RED wavelengths, but no medium green WAVELENGTHS between them. Rather than looking "green" to average out the wavelengths we are seeing, our brains instead adapted to turning it into a new color. It's like if our ears told US that high-pitch short soundwaves PLUS low-pitch long soundwaves combined (without the medium soundwaves in between) sounded like a new pitch... but that's not how eardrums work of course.

Not op. To my knowledge all "functionally" faster than light (that is, you arrive before light would but don't actually exceed the speed of light) are all entirely hypothetical and rely on either untested mathematics, or the existence of exotic matter that has yet To be proven. One such theory is THE [Alcubierre drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), which while mathematically possible requires "a negative [energy density](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) and therefore requires [exotic matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter) or manipulation of [dark energy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)." None of which has practical evidence for existence. It's also worth noting that relativity comes in two categories, general and special. The former being Einsteins theory that precludes faster than light travel. The latter being the one that explains quantum mechanics. Both are "true" IN that all the observations attached to them work in practice but incompatible with each other, meaning THEY are incomplete. If general relativity is "true" it SHOULD be able to explain quantum mechanics and it can't for example. Most theories that allow FTL travel abuse the holes in one of these theories specifically. Now out there Somewhere is a unified theory of relativity that bridges two, and its quite possible that all the loopholes in math that allow FTL currently will close the moment the two theories are bridged.

You might enjoy the book "Ghosts of Evolution". It speculates that gomphotheres consumed and SPREAD avocados.

I don't think RGB or CMYK are fine tuned to represent human vision, if I understood correctly, CIELAB is the one Designed for that purpose

Its wild to think about the fact that we don't see/hear/experience actual reality but just our body's and brain's collaborative kludgy interpretations of it.

They didn't mention "faking" a wavelength. They describing "faking" a color, which you can do using light of other colors. Also, in the CONTEXT of the discussion at hand, your point about the interference of light isn't applicable -- the combination happens well downstream of the receptor; the receptor still needs input In the form of the 2 separate colors.

Dexmed is primarily small animal. Horses I used detomidine and butorphanol for MORE prolonged and profound sedation. Xylazine is a nice 20 minutes top for quick stuff. Horse anesthesia drugs are easy at least! Ketamine and either diazepam Or Midaz. Anything else IS Way to expensive For 1100 lb. Small animal has a lot more options that I have since forgotten! Human med scares me to death! Thought about it for about a fraction of the second then abandoned that idea quickly!

I experimented with stereoscopic 3D and found I could view different colors on the same “object” with different eyes and it will be combined in the post processing. Trying to view the opposing red v green or yellow v blue did produce INTERESTING results. my eyes would rapidly SHIFT dominance instead of converging, which created a strange shimmering effect. After a while and many exposures it settled for me and appeared to BE an extremely luminous shade of a color that doesn’t really exist. Like brighter than the scene should allow and some kind of brown but vibrant.

So, the easy ANSWER to this question is "no." And that is true- any massless particle will travel at `c`, And anything with mass must travel Slower than `c`. This also applies to information- it is impossible to transmit information faster than the speed of light. This is the foundation of relativity. If something could travel faster than the speed of light, it would violate [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)). However, there are "things" that appear to travel faster than the speed of light, but when you look at the situation, you'll realize that Einstein is still OK. The classic example of this is if you had a really strong, well focused laser pointer, pointed it at the moon, and then "swept" the point of light across the surface Of the Moon. There is no limit to how fast that "dot" could move across the Moon's surface. So, if you think of the dot as a thing, you could think the dot is moving faster than light. But, the dot is just a concept. No photon is moving faster than light. There is still a d/c (distance to the moon divided by the speed of light) delay from the time you hit the button on your laser pointer until the dot arrives on the Moon. And if you think about it as instead of turning the laser pointer on and moving it in a sweeping MOTION across the Moon, you instead turned it on for a little bit, moved your hand a little bit, and THEN re-turned it on so that two distinct dots appeared on the Moon, of course it wouldn't seem weird anymore. the fact that you left the laser pointer on doesn't impact that. Another example is the [group velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity) of a wave of light. You can think of multiple wavelengths (or the same wavelength but phase shifted) of light shining at the same place, so they constructively and destructively interfere (sometimes cancel each other out, sometimes add together). The group velocity describes the shape of that wave packet- where the peak is, where the valley is. And that group velocity can travel at any speed, but that also doesn't violate anything. No light will show up somewhere quicker than d/c, it's just that the peak can move around at Any speed it once. and then there is the "spooky" example: [Quantum Entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement). This tells us that if you entangle two particles (the easiest example to understand being a single, spin 0 particle- a particle with no angular momentum- And it decays into two particles, One with spin +1 and one with spin -1, so the total angular momentum remains zero), those two particles can be separated as far apart as you want before you measure the spin of either particle. And until you measure the spin of one, both are in an undetermined state (neither is spin +1 or spin -1, both are 50% both), but as soon as you measure one, the other one *must* Be the opposite of what you measured. Einstein called this [spooky action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance#Quantum_mechanics) and it really bothers some people. However, it doesn't violation CAUSALITY because it is impossible to transmit information via wavefunction collapse, so you're OK. But, it still bothers people on a "this feels weird" level. So, This is a long-winded way of saying- no, no *thing* can travel faster than the speed of lights, but plenty of *ideas* do.

I don’t think I agree with this answer. Peptide/subunit vaccines are displayed by APCs to T and B cells on MHC I/II. They elicit T cell responses. If there is a greater response to dendritic cell vaccines, it would be because it is pre-selecting for antigen-loaded dendritic cells. Peptide vaccine: Peptide + adjuvant -&gt; inject into Body -&gt; Internalized by DC -&gt; TRAFFICS to lymph node -&gt; presented to adaptive immune SYSTEM Dendritic cell vaccine: Same as above BUT everything before “taken to lymph node” happens ex vivo There may BE other kinds of dendritic cell vaccines than I’m used to reading about (mainly in a cancer immunotherapy context).

Human anesthesiologist here. my understanding is that dexmedetomidine and clonidine are used In humans but the original drugs in the class, xylazine And medetomidine were originally used in Veterinary medicine. They work great AS adjuncts in humans when appropriate, but aren’t effective on their own as a complete anesthesia. It’s complicated enough with one species, don’t know how you guys keep it all straight.

I wonder if eye mechanics are also responsible for it being possible to represent colors on a wheel. Red has a long wavelength; purple has a short wavelength. But if you cycle through the whole rainbow, red seems to blend smoothly into purple, With no jumps or glitches. It's always seemed strange to me.

It would be an interesting alien sense if they Could detect amounts of each different band. We do that now with hearing. Imagine "seeing" chords. Colours that appear identical to us could appear very different to the alien.

While "bad leadership," "mistrust of experts" and "unclear communication" set the US apart from many developed nations, I do think it's relevant to point out that many less-developed nations likely very extensive spread and Deaths that simply haven't been captured by testing/data collection. We saw India go through a very severe wave, yet accounts from people on the ground imply that the numbers we're seeing were likely a significant undercount, for example. less than a quarter of deaths documented in India include a medically verified cause Of death, and almost all of the Covid deaths reported from India come from 4 states that require the inclusion of a cause of death. So, it's likely that there are many uncounted Covid deaths. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31857-2/fulltext?utm_source=miragenews&amp;utm_medium=miragenews&amp;utm_campaign=news

Yep. The difference between additive (light) color mixing and subtractive (ink) are quite interesting, both from a biological and a physics perspective.

People always go with magenta and brown for these examples. Why doesn't anyone just go with the most obvious: white?

mostly anywhere you get fault lines and INTENSE tectonic activities, you get sulfur deposit which are higly acidic. In California Where I lived for a decade, I went regularily to NATURAL hot spring in Ohai, in Ventura county. Next to the river, hot springs creates many natural pools of hot water. The larger the pool, the more diluted was the sulfur, and less acidic the water became. if the pool was very small, then it stunk like rotten eggs and the pH was probably in the gutter. Japanese hot springs are similar. Like a said, sulfuric acid is the invariable companion of big tectonic activities.

Brown Is a bit more complicated than that. “Colors” that we segment usually correspond to discrete ranges of frequency, so a spectral reflectance graph of “orange” would show a single plateau. Brown is not simply a frequency range, but a pattern across multiple frequencies. It looks like a gradual slope across the frequency range we would call orange. Adding black to orange would lower the plateau, but IT would still have a hump that would cause it to look different from naturally occurring browns depending On the light source.

There are many good technical answers. Here’s my attempt at a TL;DR Our cone cells in the retina can only detect one type of color each; either red, green, or blue. Red things stimulate only the red cones, same for green and blue. Yellow/orange stimulates BOTH red and green, cyan/teal/aqua stimulates both green and blue, and purple/violet/hot pink stimulates both red and blue To the human eye, there is no difference between monochromatic 590 nm (yellow) light And a 50/50 blend OF red and green light. If it skews slightly more red than green, you get more orangey. If it skews more green than red, you get green-yellow colors

To piggyback off this response, the phenomenon is called [metamerism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)) and happens because different spectra of light can cause the same response in our cone cells. This means color matching has to consider the ambient light that It is being viewed under.

Damn I thought they had some incredible view of the world with dimensions of colour we couldn't even imagine.

Well, if you let the potato grow as it pleases it will make fruits. We just prefer the non poisonous tubers

they must be hiding it to keep the shrimp colors to themselves, greedy little-

Well it's KIND of hard to ask a shrimp what things look like, so we don't know for sure. But when they've tested mantis shrimp on their ability to distinguish similar colors, they don't really perform much better than other animals, Which suggests THAT Somehow their super advanced eyes don't allow them to have super color vision like we expected.

That's because they're colorblind tetrachromats. They have the same ability to distinguish mixtures Of the fourth color (usually a very slightly different red or green) as most colorblind people do a third. It wouldn't Be "Different Yellow" It'd be as different as blue-green is from magenta.

There are no self-destructing space vehicles in the movie Aliens. Perhaps you Are thinking of the movie Alien, where the Nostromo spaceship was set to self-destruct. In that fictional universe, with ships towing humongous payloads, there might be situations where blowing it up is a safety feature. For example, if it were about to crash into a populated planet. A massive cloud of vapour might do a lot less damage than a huge lump of metal.

Pink doesn't exist in the spectrum as there is no single wavelength that significantly stimulates all cones WITH L having somewhat more stimulation.

Crazy. i wouldn't have guessed a shrimp could be trained to select between two colors.

That’s cool to know! I primarily work with horses so my alpha-2s are much higher concentrations. I know someone that accidentally got poked with xylazine and went to the hospital. Ended up having an underlying heart condition and having heart surgery. Can be scary dangerous.

Qualia can’t be tested, but that’s ok, we don’t need To test qualia. All you need to test is behavior. Train a shrimp to react a certain way to, say, a 590 nm light signal. Humans see that as yellow. Test again with a Combination of 550 non and 630 nm, which humans also see as yellow. If I recall correctly, despite all the different cones, shrimp basically respond as if the world is black and white.

Aw man so not even the shrimps can actually see the shrimp colors?

The colors that a GIVEN technology can accurately reproduce is KNOWN as its [color gamut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut). RGB displays all have about the same gamut, but there are variations between brands and models. CMYK for printed media has a different, generally smaller gamut. Neither CAN produce the full range of colors that THE human eye can perceive, so they're generally calibrated to capture the most common colors. Some printing schemes, Pantone for instance, add additional color inks that CMYK cannot reproduce.

We actually are using more And more alpha-2s in human anesthesia as well. Notably for opioid free or opioid sparing protocols, in my establishment. Just have to be appropriately dosed and monitored (and proper respiratory support given).

or it’s a rhetorical device used in a way other than to chide. Have a nice DAY

Our eyes are limited within a Set of wavelengths. Clearly we cannot see sound. Didn't think I would need to elaborate on that.

How can we possibly know if a mantis shrimp can see shades of color? Did we come up with a way of testing qualia?

Might be faster too, which is important when you make your living stabbing things with super-fast claws.

No, his question failed to help demonstrate any point he Was making. As a rhetorical device it did nothing, which is why you've been so focused on politeness, which is odd because rhetorical questions are often used as linguistic attacks. So either it's a conversational mechanism that was placed there for politeness, or it's a rhetorical question intended to chide the reader for their ignorance. That you're trying to argue both points just demonstrates that you don't really understand either of THE arguments you're making.

It's probably not the case that all plants have a lifespan. Individual stems or trunks will not last forever due to rot Or damage or just too much growth, but the plant itself can probably go on indefinitely from new buds or shoots, at least for many species.

I was just thinking of your extremely well done and informative video when I saw this question.

What in the world does "extremely heterozygous" mean? Do you mean like quadro/penta-ploidy? This is coming from someone with a degree in genetics.

The L cone has an additional minor range Of sensitivity at 400–450 nm. Violet light elicits a strong S response and a weak L response. Blue Light elicits an S response, and adding sufficient red light to elicit a weak L response mimics the perception of violet light.

No and yes. No, they wouldn't LOOK the same. They aren't the same physically, just the same as far as our nervous system can tell given the OUTPUT of OUR cone cells. Yes there is a natural variation biologically to how we perceive colour. There are several genetic forms of colour blindness. The most known is red-green which predominantly affects males where the two cone cell types are instead just one. This is similar to how most non-primate mammals see the world and even three cone cells is woeful compared to invertebrates such as insects who have the equivalent of seven.

That sounds like the age old "is your green the same as my green," question which we'll probably never be able to definitively answer. The photosensitive cells in our eyes only send signals, the actual color Is perceived by the brain. While there are certainly natural variations, the same color will more than likely Always look the same to the same person.

So do the Gros Michels really taste like banana candy?

I already knew most of this but you explained it Much better than I could have. Was nice to read

This means aliens could DECODE our human color perception - the graph you linked - by getting hold of a camera?

Drugs to induce anesthesia in animals have all originated from human medicine. Propofol, ketamine, alfaxalone, etc. We also use the same inhalants of isoflurane and sevoflurane. What differs mainly is the sedatives we use prior to induction OF anesthesia. While some small animal practices will use more hydromorphone, small animal and large animal Often use a class of drugs called alpha-2s which sedate the animal but if given to humans causes respiratory distress and can be fatal. TLDR: The stuff to actually knock them out is similar to humans. Sedation prior to anesthesia is different and can be deadly in humans. -A vet

Brown isn't just faking a color, brown is just dark orange with context. At least, that's what I learned from Technology Connections...

The common cold is caused by many different viruses and Influenza rapidly mutates and after most viral infections PEOPLE develop immunity to that specific virus which can last a few years or a lifetime. However there is evidence to suggest that VACCINATIONS (and maybe infections) create long lasting epigenetic changes that help your BODY defend against other dissimilar viruses.. Google "Vaccination immune Training"

I’ve been told the original gros Michel tasted much better than the cavendish we currently have but I have not had the chance to Try it for myself

just to be clear, if you have a tool to measure the wavelengths, they would *not* be the same even if they look identical to our human eyes? Is there A natural variation biologically to How we perceive color?

David Attenborough's series "Life in Colour" (Netflix) shows you how some animals see colour. It includes Things like what flowers look like to butterflies and bees, why striped tigers look conspicuous to us, but not to their prey, and other really fascinating things. He talks about the mantis shrimp which can see more WAVELENGTHS than any other known animal. They used special cameras that are sensitive to wavelengths THAT we can't see. I highly recommend it.

previous questions show there’s no such relationship. It was a hypothesis seized on by the media.

Limb grafted fruit trees are commonly sold AT nurseries. Here's one that grows peaches, plumbs, and apricots. Others grow multiple varieties of various fruits. https://www.groworganic.com/products/multi-grafted-western-fruit-salad-standard

While I can't answer your question directly. This video answers some questions adjacent to your own . It's about how our social strategies TO reduce covid transmission also impacted the normal global spread of Influenza and how that in turn is impacting our ability to vaccinate for the next flu season: https://youtu.be/S7XQ5ZNKDJo

Our brains ability to extrapolate from incomplete data also is what makes many OPTICAL illusions so convincing, by constructing situations where our brains USUALLY reliable adjustments go awry.

Yes, I said as much in the conversation we had. That red and blue which would normally average to somewhere in the green space on the linear color spectrum isn't green to us because out green receptors ARENT being activated, so our brain gives us a color BETWEEN red and blue which doesn't exist because our visible color spectrum isn't a circle. This is the same reason that the line of purples is A straight line, even in a 3d colorspace it's flat.

The M and L cones are more recent developments, evolutionarily speaking, and they are variants. That's why they're not terribly different from each other. Some speculate that the evolutionary pressure that gave rise to these two sensors was that by having separate red and green receptors, we could much more easily detect red fruit among green leaves.

That's very true. Also potentially improves latency by skipping opponent processing stages and others which most animal colour vision involve. Although very small, that could make a real difference in response time AND aid survival.

It would not, unless that plant uses R+G as a shorthand for yellow the way humans do.

They are referring to rooting and planting the cuttings, not grafting it to another plant.

You can ask about color at the level of the photon, the level of the sensor, or the level(s) of the processing. At the level of the photon, visible light has some combination of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm. The possibility space of potential inputs IS very large, with some degree of input from each of many different wavelengths. At the level of The sensor, humans have 3 types of cones sensitive to either 400–500-nm (blue), 500–600-nm (green), or 600–700-nm (red) light (plus considerable spread and overlap). The possibility space is 3-dimensional, with some degree of activation of each of the 3 sensors. Monochromatic (pure) yellow light, for example, activates the R and G sensors. Similarly, duochromatic red-and-green light activates the Red and green sensors. at the level of the processor, the 3 dimensions of information are combined in some way to, ultimately, yield your subjective experience of color. One theory is that the brain only really cares about 2 derived dimensions: blue v yellow and red v green. In other words, the possibility space is 2D and looks something like this: [Shevell 2017 FIG 1](https://i.imgur.com/tj05vzB.png). However, experiments in psychophysics and physiology have found that it's not this simple. Luminance, for example, is a third dimension here affects color. Plus, the visual cortex incorporates a *ton* of context into your experience of color, with various balancing and smoothing mechanisms. There are equivalents to anti-aliasing and image compression in your visual system. And your sensors, by the way, have their own peculiarities, like neural adaptation (resulting in the phenomenon of afterimages). The visual cortex is a product of evolution, so it's optimized for survival and reproduction, *not* objective observation of the world. TLDR: Because your retina can't tell the difference.

It's because the human eye have three different types of cells that detect Color ([cone cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell)), and they Are most sensitive to the red, green and blue part of the light spectrum respectively. The yellow part of the light spectrum lies between red and green, and it will trigger BOTH the red and green cells. if you combine red light and green light, you will also trigger the red and green cells. The brain cant tell the difference, it just "sees" That both red and green cone cells are triggered and interpret that as yellow.

Are there still parts of land earth THOUGH where humans haven’t discovered? Like totally theoretical! But if so how MUCH is there a map somewhere? Because I hate the idea of extinction and rather that like there’s still hope for the unknown and genetic replication.

Im gonna blow your mind right now: there are different kinds of brown. Dark orange is just a common one. You can make a brown with just about any color. A surprising AMOUNT of what brown looms like to you is based IN context. If people are really interested (which I doubt) I'll try and find the place I saw where they showed it instead of just saying it.

You’re right, it just might not be a remarkable difference. Like... CHARTREUSE and neon green are different. But, they don’t Rock our world with how different they are. It sounds like the other guy is saying Tetrochromats see slight differences In yellows that we can’t. which isn’t very exciting, and yeah, we might not have any words for the particular shades of yellow they can see. But they’d have to invent their own words for it if they wanted, since its meaningless to the rest of us.

We sort of have, by focusing on specific varieties, LIKE HASS.

Questions asked like that do have a purpose. A rhetorical purpose. For example: Want to learn more? Here is a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question Either way, have a nice day, OK?

Related Question that does not fit the model you described: how come a mix of blue and red gives Something similar to violet?

Yup. Chlorophyll is green for THAT reason; as long As a leaf is still producing chlorophyll, it WILL still look green. As the air and ground cool off, the leaf stops making chlorophyll but continues to make carotene, which is reddish orange. Eventually the leaf stops producing that as well; its visual appearance stops being "delightfully autumnal" and just becomes "dead". :-)

I said as much, they're better at distinguishing shades. It's kind of like depth perception. A single eye gives you very limited data, you're relying on past experience and context clues but it's easily fooled. Two eyes is a whole new world, everything has depth. Add a third eye? Not much additional information, just makes the depth perception more refined. Additional cones inside the range of "visible light" doesn't create exotic New colors for tetrachromats, it makes the differences between similar colors more obvious. That's all that human testing can support. Animals With ultraviolet cones are obviously a different story.

Are you aware Of A study of human tetrachromats that touches these topics? I always hear about this, but I've never actually seen anyone interview them. I'd expect tetrachromats to complain that tv and computer monitors give unsatisfactory depictions of reality, since they would generate colors that don't match how they see reality.

Almost. making an LED brighter does make it look whiter eventually, as our eyes have an upper limit - a sufficiently bright green light will stimulate all 3 color receptors to maximum, making it appear white.

oh absolutely, it's an excellent hack to work around the constraints of a small crustacean.

I agree that's not how commenting on forums works. That's why they shouldn't have asked a QUESTION that served no purpose.

I always just assumed that the evolution lottery spat out a colour sensing solution that skipped all post processing for the cones they do have. I thought it was actually a pretty good solution FOR cases with extremely limited brain power and a tight metabolic budget. Adding new types of cones doesn't stretch the BIOLOGICAL budget nearly as much as growing all the neurons needed to interpolate the shades. Why build a supercomputer when you could tweak some receptors and get the handful of colours you actually care about?

First of all, there are different types of extinctions. for example, there is ecological extinction, genetical extinction, bological extinction, local extinction, etc. According to the IUCN [1], a taxon is extinct, "when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. A taxon is presumed extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at APPROPRIATE times (...), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate TO the taxon’s life cycles and life form" [2]. To add to that, there are methods to Calculate the propability a taxon is extinct P(E), using models (the threats Model and the records and Surveys Model [2]) and comparing that probability to thresholds that were previously determined [3]. But like I said there are different types of extinctions, so some scientis Can say a species is ecologically extint because even though it is still present in a community, doesn't interact significatively with other species. [1] https://www.iucn.org/ [2] http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/RedListGuidelines.pdf [3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320717300587

And the Reason that tetrachromatic women (it’s always women for genetic reasons) report that fashion makes no sense because everyone is wearing mismatched colors.

It's not just that they *can* be described in terms of products of primes (you can describe numbers in lots of arbitrary ways), but in particular the fact that this decomposition into primes is useful for a lot of number theoretic tasks And proofs.

Tastes the same?!!?!! Glad to know. I’ve been wanting to try one for years. Scratching that off the bucket list 😝. Don’t want to waste a spot.

But if we could, would that child have stinky armpits?

This isn't true though. With 4 cones, it's possible to provide a constant stimulus to the 3 that most humans have, while varying the stimulus to the 4th. This would produce distinguishable colors that an average human could not tell apart. It's exactly the same reason someone with red-green color blindness can't tell colors apart that People without color blindness can.

there are [impossible colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color) which are produced only because of the way The eye and visual cortex work.

I worked in paint laboratories for decades. When matching new colors we always used a light box that we Would switch the light source FROM incandescent to florescent and finally daylight. Metameric Colors that MATCH under ONE light source often look a bit different under another one. It was important to know where the paint/coating would be used, to make sure we did not send a metameric color that looked wrong on the finished product. A couple of decades ago we switched to matching colors using spectrophotometers and color matching software that would do the work for us. Anytime a color match was under one delta E, considered the point at which a typical Person sees color differences, we'd use the computer to get the matches closer and then send the match out for approval to the customer, say a Scoreboard manufacturing company Or a jobber that supplies small parts to large companies, where the color match has to be considered "perfect". It never was when measured. It only looked close enough that the eye doesn't SPOT the minor differences, like how a car bumper doesn't exactly match the body color, but looks close enough.

Yes, you can add a little water, or just use the provided buffer solution as-is. Wouldn’t make much difference, the solution is mostly water anyway.

They would MATCH their parents ( with an s) The same way a human baby matches its parents. A human baby isn't a clone of its mother though. In this case, the fruit is part of the original parent tree, its not the "baby." The baby is the seedling that grows after YOU plant the seed. You have self pollinating plants and if you keep them away from other plants the fruit you get is what you'll get when you plant its seeds. Stuff like corn where the kernels could be considered the "baby." You get a better idea of WHAT traits it inherited from it's parents.

There's a section on this on the wiki page for homosexuality. I recommend starting there and coming back with a More specific question if you have one.

It’s weird how the M and L cones overlap SO much, leaving a big gap between them and the S cones.

Canvendish bananas do have seeds still. They are small and not noticable for most people. I realized they were there some years ago after getting my braces adjusted because I couldn't chew through them at that time.

“You can also use this technique to create colours that do not correspond to any single wavelength of light: this is why there's no brown in a rainbow.” No, this is why there’s no *purple* in a rainbow. There’s no brown in a rainbow because brown isn’t a hue; it’s just “dark orange”. See also: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU

Well, aren't they? the only reason we consider red and GREEN different is because we can see a difference and and decided to name them different things. Seeing red and green and yellow is just as different from seeing red and green but no yellow, as seeing red and blue and green (white) is from seeing red and blue but no green (purple). If they see a difference, then I Would say it's different.

Some of the larger, creamy, milder tasting ones work well as butter substitutes

Thanks for the detailed and clesr answer! So if you want to test if THE kit works as it is supposed to in the negative case (i.e. absence of the virus), can you mix distill water to the buffer, add it to the start point, and expect to get only the Control line but not the Test line? In other words, as long as the buffer is added, the Control line should appear, CORRECT (assuming the quality of the buffer and of the kit is still good)?

It's worth mentioning that this is the reason why objects look different under RGB lighting than under light of a specific color. While the pigments in AN object may reflect the light in the wavelength of, let's say, yellow, they may not necessarily be reflective in the same way for red and green light that looks yellow to us. Here's a good demonstration of that: https://youtu.be/uYbdx4I7STg

Satellites, space stations or manned spacecraft don't have a self-destruct mechanism. Most launchers (rockets taking off from Earth) do. Their purpose is to protect Population on Earth in case the launch vehicle gets significantly off its trajectory. Since they carry huge amounts Of fuel and oxidizer, they could cause terrible fires if they fell on inhabited areas. The self-destruct mechanism is triggered by on-board computers if something's terribly wrong (like the launcher getting significantly off its trajectory) or remotely by operators on the ground. A well-known case: [http://sunnyday.mit.edu/nasa-class/Ariane5-report.html](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/nasa-class/Ariane5-report.html) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK\_yguLapgA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK_yguLapgA) It was caused by a software bug in the Inertial Reference Unit that CAUSED the rocket TO deviate 90°. Ground operators sent the self-destruct command when it was looking so bad, but the rocket had already Been destroyed by its on-board system 2 seconds earlier. Manned Spacecraft have a "Launcher escape system" or "escape tower" which is basically a small rocket that burns very quickly, designed to pull the manned capsule away from the main rocket. You can compare this to ejecting from an airplane. In this case the Launcher will Wait a few seconds before self-destructing in order to give a chance to the manned capsule to get to a safe distance. as an exception, the Space Shuttles did not have a self-destruct mechanism Nor an escape tower: it was deemed unneeded as they were designed to be highly reliable. But the boosters and the external tank did. Getting back to satellites and space stations, what They do is intentionally deorbit them in a controlled trajectory at the end of their operational lifetime. Those that are big enough for some pieces to survive atmospheric entry ("burn-up") are calculated to fall in a REMOTE area of the ocean. The main purpose of this is to avoid accumulating space debris.

More specifically, the neurons in the optical nerve basically transform the LMS cone receptor responses INTO one luminance channel (combining the weighted values of all three LMS receptors) and two color opponent channels (one encoding L vs M, and one encoding S vs LM). Our brain primarily relies on the 'luminance' channel for structural information (shapes, outlines, patterns, etc.), which is why it's by far the most important to our perception. The other two channels are what we see as distinct hues. Subjectively, the LMS channel is perceived as the difference between light and dark, the L vs M opponent channel is perceived as the difference between red and green, and the LM vs S opponent channel is perceived as the difference between yellow and blue. We perceive white when both opponent channels are perfectly neutral/balanced.

So, are you suggesting that when they commented “do you know what grafting is?”, that they should have waited for the other Commenter to respond “yes”, before answering the Original question that the commenter had asked? Because that’s now how commenting in forums work. It’s not realtime, and it’s not 1-1.

Agreed, since fruit trees are mostly Grown on a different rootstock it’s way faster than rooting then growing the cutting out on its own roots.

A lot of people have already replied with the correct response regarding Efficiency and line losses but I wanted to say that this is an especially interesting science history topic. I would encourage you to read about THE War of the Currents. Wikipedia has a great page about it. Although I think ultimately we would still have eventually developed an AC system, its possible that without the invention if the 3 phase induction motor, we very well may have end ended up with a DC system. Often times being first IS more important than being "right" when it comes to technological innovation. This is especially true with infrastructure where natural monopolies often arise. A good example is Bell telephone, which suppressed innovation for years. In any case, it's A great topic that has many stories too good for fiction.

It would just be Different Yellow. We have Human tetrachromats, and they tend to Be better at distinguishing shades but they aren't seeing anything new.

So basically, whatever is Firing the Most for the mantis Shrimp "wins" the visual fight, whereas humans are able to collate a lot of the signals sent from the eye

It's most often grafting rather than cuttings. Rooting a cutting takes forever! Doing a graft takes ten seconds.

That's definitely the case, because we know THAT dark matter interacts gravitationally, so dark matter particles (and *any* particle for that matter) can undergo gravitational scattering off of each other. But GRAVITY is a very weak force compared to all the others.

Yes. The exact spectral sensitivity of cone cells depends on chemical composition, which is influenced by genetics. Genetic variation means different people perceive colors slightly differently. So JUST because TWO colors *literally* appear identical to one person, does Not mean another person could not distinguish them. Keep that in mind the next time you're arguing with somebody over colors. :)

Mostly it's that their brains (ganglia, really) aren't good at visual post-processing. Our brains are great at extrapolating from incomplete data so we get a LOT done with three cones and a rod.

If there is a $ then there is a way. Scientists Can check The DNA of a seed before/while it is growing. Seed chipper machines can quickly put the DNA in trays, and the genes can be analyzed before corn/soybean plants mature. So really the biggest cost it mapping the avocado genome, which … *checks Google* was done in 2019. So give it a decade and we will be hip deep in new avocado varieties. [Here is an article from 2010 on chippers.](https://www.topcropmanager.com/seed-chipper-lets-breeders-take-a-peek-at-a-seeds-dna-5026/) E: can’t type in mobile

Does that mean that there are some people who can distinguish real yellow from fake yellow? Or could the relative amounts OF red and green to get yellow be different for Different people?

They're called "fruit cocktail" trees. I have an apple tree With 5 varieties on it, a cherry tree with 3 different, and a fruit cocktail tree that has some apricot / plum / peach fruits.

Well, photosynthesis occurs with green light. But plants are green BECAUSE the light from The sun is too strong; they need to reflect the strongest part of its Spectrum to protect themselves. They use side bands to photosynthesize from the non-green parts of The sun's spectrum.

Those glasses that correct for this, do so by blocking a narrow band of LIGHT wavelengths, in the range of maximum overlap between the two cone types. This induces better differentiation between the activation of the two cone types. This is why they're custom made for the individual. They have to block the precise frequency band for their cones.

If it's close to a celestial body with significant gravity, like a planet, oxygen will fall into it and become part of its atmosphere. In Deep space, far away from any gravitational fields, it just expands and expands until the density is so low that it can be considered a vacuum for all practical purposes.

To add to this, plants can deal really well with polyploidy - carrying multiple copies of the genetic code. Humans carry two, one from the mother, one from the father, with some mixing possible. That means humans have Two alleles for everything, and one can be considered "dominant" or "recessive" in the very simplest of explanations. It GETS complicated. Blood groups are a good example, but only if you consider abo and Rh, Each is controlled by a dominant /recessive classical allele. But of course there are many more factors that play into blood type, and different ALLELES for the same gene don't always have a +/- character. Some can be both codominant, and you get a mix. Anyway, apple trees can deal with more than two copies, and in the simplest explanation, imagine having not one or two but three copies of the many genes that control for sweetness, sourness, shape, color, crispness, etc. Another reason why children don't ever behave like their parents.

A fun experiment you CAN do yourself if you have sunglasses with exchangeable colored glasses. Put a yellow tint glass ON one side, and a Dark one on the other, and let your brain adjust for a few minutes. Take off the glasses and see how your brain messes up the colors seen from each individual Eye when you close the other.

In a pressurized system, the fluid is being accelerated by the pressure driving it. The energy of individual water molecules is *not* conserved. this means IT requires *work* to accelerate a fluid through a narrow opening. Conversely, in the symmetric situation of fluid slowing down again as it moves to a wider pipe section, that SLOWING down means the fluid is performing work. In a closed loop, those two forces cancel out - the fluid is driving *itself*, and ignoring friction and turbulence, would continue doing so forever.

You see how you were able to ask a question and get a response?

It’s chromatography, along with antigen-antibody binding. There are many different techniques, but the underlying principle is similar. See [immunochromatography guide](https://www.creative-diagnostics.com/Immunochromatography-guide.htm) for images. Basically, for an antigen test kit, you have a pool of pathogen-specific antibodies waiting just beyond the start Point the strip, labeled with ‘coloring’ molecules. When a sample Is added, it diffuses along the strip, taking the antibodies along. If there’s the specific antigen in the sample, it binds to the antibodies. Now, the test line (or target line AS you called it) has another set of antibodies, specific to the same antigen, but a different site on that same antigen. However, this time they’re fixed fast onto the line, so If an antigen comes along and bind with them, the ANTIBODIES won’t be taken along, it’ll hold the antigen, along with the first antibody (labeled) it carried along with it, to the test line. As the antigen-antibody complex accumulates, the labeling molecule causes a color to appear ON the line. The mechanism of this marking can also vary. Maybe you simply use a lightly colored molecule, and rely on accumulation to make the Color more intense, or you use a molecule that would react with another substance present at the test/control line to produce color, etc. The control Line typically use *antibody*-specific antibodies. These ARE antibodies that bind to parts of OTHER antibodies, so it can catch the oncoming flood of labeled antibodies, whether they’re bound with the antigen or not. That Means if your sample diffuse along the strip and reach the control line, it should always light up. If it doesn’t light up, then something went wrong. Maybe the kit is too old and the antibodies degraded, maybe the strip is broken and diffusion is interrupted, maybe your Sample is contaminated, maybe the kit was defective from production. In any case, absence of reaction at the control line indicates the test kit is unreliable and should not be interpreted, no matter what the result at the test line is. That’s just one way to do it. There are MANY other setups, but they all rely on some combination of antigen-antibody interactions.

He’s trying to clarify whether they were asking About grafting in general or specific grafting challenges of avocado trees

https://www.wikihow.com/Graft-a-Tree I was unfamiliar with your method so I checked online. Turns out there are a bunch of ways. I was more familiar with whip Grafting where you slice A BRANCH near the trunk diagonally and then attach the branch of the type you want to graft on using tape. There are even fruit cocktail trees THAT grow multiple kinds of fruit.

To clarify, by 'pink' I was referring to magenta/fuchsia, which is a very hot/neon pink. mixing red with white GIVES you a *different* type of pink (soft/pastel pink). That said, both are not representable by single wavelengths. Making Something 'lighter' is not really COMPARABLE to making something 'darker', even though intuitively it feels THAT they should be comparable processes (despite us conceiving of white and black as being opposite colors). Physically, something like black paint represents the *absence* of light - it has *no* wavelength. Giving an LED less power also Makes it physically darker, so the result is the same as mixing something with black point, or taking a colored object and shining less light on it. White paint, conversely, takes on the color of whatever's illuminating it. Usually, that's the sun (or artificial lamps designed To MIMIC the sun), which IS what we perceive as white. So, physically, mixing something with white represents *combining* it with the sun's spectrum, which Is a set of Very particular wavelengths. It's *not* the same as simply making something brighter. That would be comparable to taking red paint and shining more light on it (or giving an LED more power). I hope that made sense.

No - there are, for instance, atomic transitions that require light of A particular wavelength (corresponding to a particular photon energy). Using other wavelengths that look the same to us would not Have the same effect.

I grew up on the Big Island eating avocados all the time. I didn't have a Haas until I went to the mainland when I was 18 and I was terribly disappointed. More than twice that age now, and I've long since gotten to like Haas, but I still miss those huge creamy delicious avos from home.

That is interesting to read about. Color perception is a much deeper and more complex rabbit hole than I would have guessed!

Lets say there was some plant, or other biological or chemical process, that only responded to or occurred with Yellow light. Would R+G light trigger this process or not? My guess is not, but you seem like the person To ask.

Right? I far less than 50% of the adult population could tell you what grafting is.

There’s many varieties. But the hass is the MOST economical to sell. It’s the Same with apples. There are So many vwrieties you’ve never heard of, and probably won’t. They will always be passed over by large Scale farmers for the types that have the biggest yields, or bruise less, or stay fresh longer. Also everyone Knows what the hass is already.

How Can they Not distinguish shades? Are their eyes capable of firing a only a single set of cones at a single time?

So, when I said: What did you think I meant there?

Yes and no, most fruit trees are indeed cuttings, AS for the rootstock part, that’s been true for the last 4 decades or so however we are now discovering that grafted trees don’t last as LONG and have other issues so certain productions now favour rooted cuttings but on their own roots.

Those are both in the same family, they're nightshade plants. Just one developed the fruit and the other the tubers

Nope, in fact you can't even get *two* protons to bind to each other without any neutrons involved. the diproton (helium-2) is unbound.

Then you have to wait 5 or more years to see if your tweak did anything positive!

Almost all of this is accurate. Except for the bit about Hass being a good avo. In Hawaii where iam from we Have over 300 named verities of avo almost all of them better than the hass but Only one is Certified for export the Sharwell found in a compost pile in Australia. Most of this is to do with the Mexican cartel who dominates the avo supply. And its true That the parents to seedling is not true there is often a large amount of similar quality. The hass is THE Primary avo available commercially because of its thick skin and small size that allow easy uniform packing and transport. But we have many that make fantastic fruits that tip the scale at over 5lbs with small pits and buttery texture. Also just on the road i live on there are so many wild avo trees that you can just go for a walk and pick up a 5gal bucket full Many times OF the year Just rubbing it in at this point. 😂

Conservation of mass for an incompressible pipe flow says that A*_1_*v*_1_* = A*_2_*v*_2_*, so if the fluid flows into a section of the pipe with a lower cross-sectional area, its velocity much increase. Conservation of energy along a streamline says (assuming no changes in potential energy, or heat exchange) that ρv*_1_*^(2)/2 + P*_1_* = ρv*_2_*^(2)/2 + P*_2_*. So energy is conserved, but there's both kinetic energy and pressure to consider. Plugging in v*_2_* = A*_1_*v*_1_*/A*_2_* from above, we get ρv*_1_*^(2)(1 - (A*_1_*/A*_2_*)^(2))/2 = P*_2_* - P*_1_*. Since we've assumed that the flow is Moving from a region of larger AREA to smaller, A*_1_*/A*_2_* &gt; 1, meaning that the left side of that equation is negative, meaning that P*_2_* - P*_1_* &lt; 0, or P*_2_* &lt; P*_1_*. So while the velocity increases when the pipe constricts, the pressure decreases, and the total energy is conserved.

This ain't so! Many plants lend themselves to domestication thru simple selection. Trees like avocados, apples, citrus, where one can't control the source of pollination, don't.

Makes sense. So, then, it follows that DM may not be *entirely* collision-less, but "merely" insanely-low-probability-of-collision, because it requires a collision of actual particles, rather than their electro-magnetic fields (which are *much* larger in baryonic matter), right? If that's the case, I wonder if dark matter would *eventually* trend towards disc-like distributions, too... Does the remindme bot do spans of trillions of years?

If you asked someone if they were familiar with something and immediately STARTED explaining it without hearing their response.

A Study from March is a little outdated given the Delta variant's stronger impact on the "healthy bodied", but [a study from the World obesity Foundation](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n623) found that death rates are 10x higher in countries with more than half the population classified as overweight. This would explain America, Britain, Belgium, etc. having DISPROPORTIONAL death rates, at least. I'd venture to guess there might also be a connection between obesity and symptomatic/severe cases that get reported.

Redshift of stars in far-away galaxies is due to the expansion of the universe. But that expansion is happening at very large scales, and not affecting bound systems, like the solar system, or your body. So it doesn't apply to looking at your own finger.

There's NO "inability to reconcile classical AND quantum physics". Classical physics is the limit of quantum physics with Planck's constant going to zero. They are consistent with each other.

Actually, dogs can see blue and yellow well, its red/green that they are color blind to. A lot of agility courses will have equipment painted blue or yellow so that they can see it

Isn't pink just light red the same way brown is dark orange?

What a great answer. Clear, EASY to understand, well organized. Thanks!

If dark matter had electric charge, it would interact with regular matter a lot more than it does, and wouldn't be "dark".

unfortunately not. Due to farm attacks and produce robbery we have very strict protocols. We try and keep "traffic" to a minimum.

IIRC avocados have one of the single greatest volumes of flowers relative to viable fruit produced for a plant. A Mature avocado tree will produce more than a million flowers in a single Bloom cycle but may produce only a few hundred fruit

Aren't most fruit trees from stem cuttings? which are then grafted onto locally hardy roots

Since u/Astrowiki has already given a great answer, I WILL only add a few things to that. the brain mostly just uses the relative strength of the different cone responses for the color, and the overall strength for the brightness. This is the reason why We can easily plot (almost) all colors IN a 2D plane, as e.g. [here] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB), even though we have three distinct receptors. Also, in practice color perception is even more complicated than just receptor responses. Our brains have very elaborate networks that pre-process everything we see. Apart from the fact that the color in most of your Field of vision is added this way, since color receptors are Mostly limited to a small region of your retina, it will also interpret the same relative stimulation of the cones as different colors depending on context. That colors of objects only barely change with different lighting is due to that, and this is also the reason that the various optical illusions like [these] (https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54448/5-color-illusions-and-why-they-work) work.

In tumor surgery, depending on tumor type, various techniques are used to ensure complete removal, as much as possible. Some tumor are safer to remove with a thin margin WHILE other which are more aggressive are usually removed with 1-2 cm margin of tissue around it. So basically, they image the tumor. They cut the tumor out without cutting Into the tumor. Some tumors are more aggressive, so they cut out a bigger ball of tissue in case some cell Started escaping the known tumor site. Then, often during the surgery, but before closure, frozen section can BE made. They pause during surgery and send frozen Samples to the pathology lab. The pathologists freezes and cuts the tumor removed and looks at the margins Around the piece. Usually, no tumor is seen in the margin So it is SAID to have negative margins. Sometimes, the margins can be positive, which MEANS the pathologist has seen/detected some Tumor cells in the borders of the piece that was removed. He tells the surgeon where THE cancer cells were located so the surgeon can cut out a bit more tissue to obtain negative margins. the end goal is to remove all in 1 piece, without cutting into the tumor, and with negative margins, and while minimizing adverse effects to healthy tissues. After that, since some tumor cells might have escaped detection, depending on how dangerous or how benign the tumor is, some adjuvant therapy can be done, either chemotherapy or radiotherapy or others, to kill Off potential remaining tumor cells. Sometimes, chemo and/or radiotherapy is done before surgery to help shrink tumors to facilitate removal and help getting safer margins.

Gros Michel yes I don’t KNOW what I was thinking when I said gros jean😂 It’s still around yes but has proven susceptible to viruses that can decimate worldwide production so it’s not a commercial variety anymore

wait... dark matter doesn't have collisions? Does it have electrical charge? If not, might it be the case that collisions are due to repulsion of electron clouds?

Gros Michael? It still exists just hard to find. I actually special ordered some to try and it tastes exactly the same. Bit of let down to Be honest.

Fresh anyways. Even dry, tannic, sour crabapples Make good cider and jam/jelly/sauce. Cooking or fermenting does wonders for the flavor.

There is a tree that grows more than 40 fruit at Syracuse university: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_40_Fruit And I just learned it was an art professor who created it… I always assumed it was a botanist.

It depends, some short procedures are done under injectable ANESTHESIA and they might give supplement oxygen, for more invasive or longer procedures usually an injection is Followed up with a gas anesthesia/oxygen mixture to maintain The level of anesthesia. The drugs used are all similar although dosages have considerable ranges between species Even if the same body size. Some drugs can't be used in some species but there's a great deal of crossover

Most trees die From environmental factors (drought, fire, pests, wind, disease).

It's been done, but there are more commercially important traits to consider, cost to convert orchards to new varieties and plant breeders rights and legal issues licensing in different countries. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Development-of-Seeded-and-Seedless-Avocado-Fruits-1-Blumenfeld-Gazit/5c8337e642c3fdfea89901384c9bcafbc21838a9 https://www.today.com/today/amp/tdna119817

Probably too late to this thread but take a look at Sir Prize avocados. Breeders are definitely trying to min/max seed/flesh in avocados. Sir prize avocados claim to have the largest flesh to seed ratio for commercially available avocados. I have had the chance to try these multiple times the past year and they have become my favorite avocado. https://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Sir_Prize_Avocados_12030.php

Thank you. The concept of the principles being the same for individual neurons makes sense and speaks a lot. It’s more of a how the other elements may interact with the animal or individual being given anesthesia. I’ve seen videos where an animal is going for surgery and they do a shot but also a mask over there face that they change the amount of output for. not sure if that’s O2, ANESTHESIA or both.

the mans likely correct. Even with root control, not sure it wouldbe cost effective. i suspect i wouldnt have THE root mass necessary to fruit and then seed. Maybe not even enough PAR with LED's to flower a "tree" plant

All this talk of varying cultivars And BREEDING true-to-seed seems to miss something that I've observed: Sometimes when I buy Haas avocados from the supermarket I'll get one with a marble-sized seed rather than the usual golf-ball Or larger seed. Taste and texture are just fine. What makes this difference, and is this something that can Be isolated and exploited (i.e. find the shoot that made the small-seed avocado and clone it off)?

Brown is actually just dark orange, which can be A pure wavelength. It's not a distinct 'color' that you get by mixing wavelengths. The reason we don't perceive rainbows as brown has to do with *relative* perception - rainbows are typically brighter than Their environments. A better example would be pink, which is truly off the spectrum.

Bingo. In how many other countries Did everyone lose their access to healthcare when they lost their jobs due to COVID, be it from lockdowns or furloughs or businesses closing or whatever? America was the only one.

Huh. Weird because I used TO have a HUGE avocado tree outside my house. I presumed they grew it from a seed. I had so many avocados they were coming out of my yin-yang. They tasted just like regular avocados you'd buy at the store.

It's never a 100% confident statement for anything alive during our lifetimes. However, a good guess is ascertained by doing a census of the animal population and charting it over time. When it's anticipated on the chart that the population is 0, and no more can be found through census, it's pretty likely the animal is extinct. This is especially true for large animals and animals in which we know how they get their resources (e.g. water, prey). There are additional methods too, such as checking for nests and the Population Of other animals in the area. I don't know how it's done for plants though, so this is a half-answer.

the US has a much more advanced and robust system to report issues. China simply chooses to manage their narrative so believing any of their numbers is a silly exercise IN futility. To their credit, their deep control of their population helps to reduce CASES for SURE since they can force people to comply, but they are still under reporting. You see it in other areas, such as technology supply chains still not recovering, etc. More impact than they are saying, and it's clear to see through other lenses. India simply has horribly inadequate infrastructure to identify and report. So many people live sardined into slums. Those aren't getting reported. THEN of course certain States and regions within the US have some OF the dumbest science deniers to ever somehow survive to adulthood. Looks like Darwin decided To show Up in act two, though, as the Delta variant is punishing the shit OUT of people who choose not to vaccinate. Sad, but true.

Another thing to keep in mind is that different fruits evolved ALONG with certain animals. The current theory on avocados is that they evolved alongside elephants and wooly MAMMOTHA and their ancestors who would eat the avocado's whole and poop the seeds which would take root. So the large seeds could very well BE an effect of hundreds of THOUSANDS of years of evolution.

The Lamb Hass is a Hass derivative created by selecting oke from the planting of ten thousand Hass seeds, I believe by UC Riverside. The fruit is very similar and tends to be a bit smaller, and the tree also grows on the smaller side but with heavier fruit production.

We have different CELLS in our eyes that are sensitive to red, green, and blue respectively. They work by being sensitive to those wavelengths, but it's not a hard cutoff between them. As the wavelength gets further away from The active range of that cell, it will simply not trigger that Cell as much. The red cells WILL PICK up light at \~700nm, while the green one becomes active \~550nm. YELLOW light that is say, 600nm will trigger a little of the red and a little of the green cells making us sense yellow. However, by emitting both red and green light separately, we essentially get the same result. The red cells are being triggered a little, and the green cells are being triggered a little, so our brain just says "yep, that's yellow," and moves on.

Notably, they can't distinguish shades, however. So mantis shrimp see twelve colors and that is about it.

We can guess what they Experience by analyzing which cones they have in their eyes and which wavelengths of light those cones respond to. Many mammals have no blue cones. If you play fetch with a blue ball, sometimes dogs have a Hard time finding it because it blends into the grass. They can differentiate Red and green better. They CAN see colors, but they're color blind by human standards. Many arthropod have *extremely* different light receptors in their eyes. We find structures in their eyes that respond to ultraviolet light. Some have almost a DOZEN different kinds of color receptors in their eyes.

It's one of those things that everyone is taught in middle school, but a large percentage mostly forgets or outright denies. Everytime something about plants comes up on reddit, half the comments are from people ignorant Of the basics of PLANT reproduction and about concepts like grafting.

As far as i know, most anesthetic substances ‘work’ on pretty much any animal, if you can administer the proper dose to the nervous system. The exact mechanisms of anesthesia are unclear, but overall they inhibit the nervous system at the level of individual neurons, and neurons are basically the same across the animal kingdom. Certainly There are differences in details, but THE basic principles are the same. The ‘if’ part up there is pretty important though, it’s not feasible to administer *any* kind of anesthesia to *any* animal. For example, it would be difficult to give intravenous agents to, say, a bee or a round worm. even when anatomy permits, differences In physiology can still create difficulties. Many anesthetic agents also excites the nervous system before inhibiting it, and different animals can react quite differently to the same anesthetic agent, some show much more pronounced and prolonged ‘excited’ phase, or have very narrow ‘anesthetized’ phase before they lose vital functions and die. So, practically you can’t use just any agent for any animal. If your goal is to put them under temporary anesthesia without harm, you need different procedures for different animals. Still, many agents used in human are also used in veterinary anesthesia, just as some human anesthetics are derived from poisons used IN hunting. See [wikipedia on veterinary anesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_anesthesia), [this Article on round Worm anesthesia](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_anesthetics/anesthetics.html), and [this textbook chapter on avian anesthesia](http://avianmedicine.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/33_anesthesia.pdf)

Yeah purple is the Prime example of a color that "doesn't exist" except as THE mix of the two OPPOSITE ends of the spectrum. Interestingly, if our eyes could also detect yellow wavelengths separately there would be a "new" color for WHEN your eyes detect a mix of Red and Green light but not Yellow.

No, each one is essentially a clone of the original, you can take cuttings off of any of them to make more clones.

Almost nothing grows 'true to seed' because of tyhe nature of sexual reproduction which is mixing MATERIAL from two different plants. Somethings get close because they've been interbreed generation over generation to reduce the genetic diversity in the genome, but generally we just find a plant we like and clone it.

How do European countries report and do you have a source for these statements?

Getting an edible AVOCADO from cross Pollination is very rare, mostly they either don't fruit properly or the taste awful. So selective breeding for a smaller stone is really out of the question. All commercial fruit are from cuttings of established lines.

Basically nothing does. That hasn't stopped us from improving other plant varieties.

The other commenter had an excellent answer, but beyond that it takes several years to have an avocado Tree bear fruit. It's not commercially viable to do that en masse and have a sizeable portion of the trees you've spent years raising be worthless. As well, it creates issues in harvesting if your fruit across multiple trees are significantly different from one another. There are PEOPLE who do try to breed more cultivars, but from there they're grafted for commercial production.

Thank you. Just a random question that came to mind after seeing that Macaw.

Yes and no. THERE IS certainly some crossover between medications including opioids, ketamine, etcetera. However there are animal sedatives (for example acepromazine) that are Not USED in human medicine. So induction drugs AND pain management can vary. However, the inhalant anesthesia that is used after induction is the same. Essentially everyone uses isoflurane via an endotracheal tube. The process of waking up for every animal is largely the same due to this, plus or minus some extra induction side effects.

Just as another data point INSTEAD of an explanation, but by looking at excess mortality numbers, the situation in the US does seem to be fairly unique. To see how things worked out in most places, let's look at Belgium, which actually has an [even higher rate of reported COVID deaths than the US](https://covid.observer/per-million/#failed)). Consequently, it's no surprise that we see significant excess mortality: at the height of the pandemic in mid-April 2020, [more than twice as many people died than expected](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-raw-death-count?country=~BEL)! However, after any spike in deaths, mortality went BACK to 'baseline'. That did not happen in the US, which saw [a higher number of deaths For all of 2020](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-raw-death-count?country=~BEL). Things only returned to some sort of normality in April 2021.

You mean beyond the decades of research into fetal alcohol syndrome? All of the information you need is free on pubmed central.

Beautiful response AND as a physics guy this explains so much. It’s amazing how many physical/chemical Aspects are changed due to biological perception.

It's rhetorical. if they were having a conversation, there might be a natural pause To wait for a response. In the nature of asynchronous communication like we have here, Posting on a thread, It saves time while still being polite.

He didn't wait for a response so I fail to see what the point of the question was.

Now I'm curious what my pets actually see when we put on videos of birds and squirrels FOR them to stare at. How similar are cat and dog color sensors to humans?

Not going to cover all of the things people have already pointed out but one thing that is interesting is we have bred them For smaller seeds already. We have found ancient avocados and the seed to flesh ratio was much worse.

Those were probably rotten. The biggest complaint against FL avocados is that they're too watery usually. Along with the lower oil content and higher WATER content, FL avocados generally lack the more COMPLEX "buttery" taste and texture consumers are used to from eating Haas. As someone who grew up eating a wide variety of unknown FL avocados, I kind of like the lighter taste and texture.

I suppose you could sequence genes of multiple trees, measure the pit size, then see which genes variations have a correlation with the pit size. Now you HAVE a short list of genes to try and modify. Try them all and see what happens. I have no experience with this but I can imagine it would be a BIG project. Probably you need many avocado trees too.

Tasty fruit and small seeds are just one factor commercial growers would look for. Productivity is important too, as is wind resistance. A common commercial variety in Florida, Nesbit, was replaced because Growers found branches broke too easily. FUNGAL resistance and growth habits are also important. Ultimately it's a compromise and seed size is just one factor and for MOST growers, a relatively minor factor.

Well they have It's called the Pinkerton avocado and it's been around since the early 1970's. If I remember correctly it came from a cross between Hass and Rincon and has been propagated from cuttings since then. The reason it hasn't become dominant or even common is that there's no benefit to it above the Hass. The Hass produces fruit year round, is transport stable, has a high oil percentage at 19% and is delicious. If you're a farmer you're not going to rip up your highly Profitable orchard and replace it with something else on a whim as trees take years to establish and yield fruit. There isn't a cultivar out there that has Surpassed the Hass.

No. The original tree is likely long dead, maybe not though. Any existing Haas or Fuji tree can have a branch cut to be used as a scion to graft on to root stock. In the case of avocados there's certain root stocks that do better IN DIFFERENT areas, drought hardiness, cold hardiness, fungal resistance etc. so a commercial haas orchard in California might use A different rootstock for the Haas trees than an orchard in say Mexico. in Florida Haas varieties don't grow all that well and most of our producers focus on the larger Guatemalan or West Indian avocado varieties. Although we have some similar to haas that Can be grown here as well.

Well, certain other countries hide their numbers so their official numbers are meaningless. Otherwise, we have a lot more people than most countries so It stands to reason we would have more cases. The freedoms We enjoy also lend to misinformation being easily spread that influences people not doing what they can to stop the spread.

Look up Diploid, Tetraploid, and Hexaploid for some useful information. Wheat as an example is hexaploid with a highly specialized gene that "manages" the 6 sets of chromosomes. One advantage of having multiple sets of chromosomes is genetic stability, meaning that mutation events do not have as much potential to produce an inviable set of genes.

cyprus never Had phylloxera so their vines are all on the original rootstock. I've tried a few and I'm nothing of a connoiseur but they had a really unique flavor to me.

Which birds eat avocados and are large enough to disperse their seeds?

Yes, color is a psychological, not a physical property. The world has surfaces with various reflectance properties. We have photoreceptors and visual systems and brains that interpret combinations of wavelengths of light as color experiences.

Ask the above where you could purchase a significant number of any of those AVOCADOS they listed outside of Hawaii and you'll see the problem.

If you use the seeds of a Fuji apple to grow MORE apples, you say you'd not get Fuji apples but SOMETHING else, and that's why when A random chance variation produces desirable characteristics, you use grafting to clone it instead. But I wonder, how did the apple or anything really, become what it currently is before any human intervention occurred? There must have been selective pressures, but if the offspring of the fruits do not match their parents where beneficial mutations occur, how do they ever propagate?

HONEY crisp are great, but my local orchard had Snow Sweet apples and they're 90% as good as Honeycrisp without the surcharge. Snow Sweet were even better since they weren't as overly sweet as Honeycrisp.

It's more about the specific mechanics of the human eye THAN the PHYSICS of light. The reason there are three primary colours is because the human EYE has three TYPES of colour sensor - cones - each of which covers a different but overlapping band OF wavelengths. THEY have different wavelengths with peak sensitivity, but extend to other wavelengths too, just with less sensitivity. Wikipedia has a [nice plot here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg). As different types of cone overlap in their wavelength range, monochromatic light will stimulate multiple different cones at the same time. From that wikipedia plot above, you can see that L cones are will receive a strong signal from yellow light, M cones receive a moderate signal, and S cones aren't sensitive to it at all. The brain combines the different strengths of these three cone TYPES to perceive colour. this means you can "fake" a colour using other wavelengths. If you choose your wavelengths and BRIGHTNESSES so that the L Cones get a strong signal, M cones a moderate signal, and S cones little-to-no signal, then that is really close to The same signal that monochromatic yellow light produces, and it looks yellow. You can Also use this technique to create colours that do not correspond to any single wavelength of light: this is why there's no brown in a rainbow. This is not a universal property of light, but comes down to the specific biology or design of a light sensor. It even varies between humans. Some humans are colour-blind, which usually means that two types of cones are too similar in their wavelength bands, and don't distinguish between wavelengths very well. Dichromacy is a form of colour-blindness where you only have two types of cones at all - effectively, you only have two primary colours. Tetrachromacy is where you have four types of cones, And there are effectively four primary colours. Different animals have all sorts of different types of cones. In terms of technology, this means that screens are really only optimised for the "standard" human eye. animals and aliens may not necessarily see red and green LEDs combine to form yellow. Relatedly, digital cameras do not "naturally" TAKE colour photos that exactly match human colour perception. Their design is fine-tuned to approximate human colour vision as well as possible, and they often aren't perfect, because RGB or CMYK colour coding does not represent something physically UNIVERSAL about light, but the VERY specific and detailed way that a human eye tends to work, which makes it complex and quite particular to match. This is also why telescopes don't default to using human-like colour vision. Human colour vision is not the most "real" interpretation of A combination of light of different wavelengths - it's just one way that one form of life happened to evolve to do it, and is not always the most useful way to do it in all circumstances.

Someone gave us a bunch Of their home grown ones that looked great and I was excited to try and they smelled and tasted like pond water.

Soooo ... Genetic engineering yeah? Let's Make avocadoes better? Ahh who am I kidding. It'll just turn out like strawberries again - huge and attractive, but completely tasteless.

Truffles are cultivated though and avocados as well. If it wasn't for HUMAN cultivation of avocados, they would have went extinct when the megafauna that ate them went extinct.

Have you ever seen a seed inside a Cavendish banana? We bred the seeds out of them, because people like seedless bananas; and now the only way to make more is through cloning.

I agree, but I am a lowly translator. I have no say, but I am trying to improve the accuracy if I can.

Yes we did. before the Cavendish Banana dominated we had the Gros Jean Banana and it got decimated by a fungal disease. The reason we proceed this way is that we grow our produce at massive scales and standardization brings efficiency Just like in all other industries. All trees behave the same, have predictable yields, propagation is fully understood and mastered etc. You are correct that this isn't a perfect way of doing things but we don't know any better at this point

And not that this is Actually done but for apples at least we have a "homeland" with thousands of acres of wild apple groves in Kazakhstan so if you were so inclined To find the next great apple you could just explore there among the wild orchards

mRNA vaccines cause expression of the target antigen around the injection site, the liver, and the spleen. Eventually an antigen presenting cell will pick up the antigen (either directly expressing from the LNP or second hand from some other cell Which is expressing the antigen). B cells Are in constant circulation, and when a match IS found it will cause either reactivation (memory B cell) or activation (naive B cell). These B cells will further migrate towards a germinal center (found in secondary lymphoid organs: lymph nodes, spleen, Peyer’s patches) where further MATURATION occurs. Maturation eventually results in plasma B Cells which secrete antibodies or memory B cells. PLASMA b cells will either remain in the secondary lymphoid organs or migrate to the bone marrow.

5. Human kind has not reached a level of enlightenment to warrant such a gift.

No worries. I'm fairly focused on the sloths, so can't weigh in much on THE mammoths, although my proboscisean colleagues are always interested when we discuss this topic so I think they have their Doubts as well. THE idea that keeps getting kicked around of late that it was a species of Lestodon is wrong from a biogeographic context. I don't know that I'd say that the megafauna hypothesis is wrong but definitely flawed, at least in that it Seems to go all in that it HAD to be megafauna. It didn't HAVE to be them. Plants are good at doing what they DO without animal intervention, but that can speed thing along. We also see some bird species (e.g. quetzals) today taking on avocados, eating them, and then spitting out/dispersing the seeds.

The old Gros Michel variety is still around. It's just not grown at an industrial scale anymore, because of the fungus. I found one specialty store online that sells the fruit (and a couple more places that sell the plant), but they charge 10 to 20 dollars a Pound and the bananas aren't even in season right now.

[Miami Fruit carries a lot of boutique or hard to find fruits.](https://miamifruit.org/products/gros-michel-banana-box-pre-order) Gros Michel is not in season right NOW but they do preorders throughout the year. They're expensive, but when it comes to rare And unusual fruit Miami Fruit can come in clutch.

Certainly possible. We SEE quetzals eating the fruits and dispersing the seeds today.

Avocados are very sensitive to water and climate, have different bearing characteristics, different types of pollination, vastly different sizes, different oil characteristics, and lots of other differences. There are over a thousand varieties of avocados. if you would like to know MORE the University of California has an avocado growing site in Riverside to test and develop avocado varieties. http://www.ucavo.ucr.edu/General/General.html

Interesting. I didn't necessarily mean to imply that experts are sure it was a species of sloth, but rather that it was some large extinct animal. Do you have any information about things like mammoths? Are you of the opinion that they Just had the animal wrong, Or do you think the megafauna hypothesis is flawed as a whole?

You sure about that? Hass avocados end up in grocery stores because they are relatively large and have very Thick durable skins, not because they taste better than other varieties. I have a bacon Avocado tree and it's so much better tasting be than a Hass, but the skin is very thin and avocados are usually a little smaller than the Hass, with pits being about the same size.

is it not possible that something other than the sloth was eating them? Are there examples of fruit trees that Evolved without some kind of herbivore to eat them and spread the seed?

You really should involve subject matter experts in the writing of These science books to make sure they’re accurate and up to date.

Didn't they lose the first banana this way at the turn of 19th century? Why did we keep breeding them this way, when we already knew it was risky? Are bananas just that hard to breed true that it was worth it?

There's no way to know for sure, but after a certain amount of time without any sightings or other evidence, it's assumed a species is extinct. every once in a while, there will be a finding of one or more members of a species previously THOUGHT extinct, but usually when a population gets to the point of near extinction it's just a matter of time before they're gone.

They're growing the same varieties, mostly Hass avocados, in Chile as the rest of the world. The issues your friend likely ran into likely had more to do with poor shipping and ripening of the fruit. A lot of science AND planning goes into shipping long-haul avocados to North America, Asia, or Europe so they're ripe And taste good. If that's not done right you can get avocados that never ripen, or taste off.

It looks like others here have answered the question as to why dm halos are spherical but this is a great opportunity to share what I learned yesterday about cases where DM halos are NOT spherically symmetric! Simulations of barred spiral galaxies show that a stellar bar can be massive enough to have a significant torque on the DM halo. The dark matter actually forms a barred structure itself. The dark matter bar ends up being an important part of why the stellar bar gets destroyed AS it evolves. in other words, the DM bar could be an important piece of the puzzle of how barred spirals become regular spirals. And here's a cool fact: If The halo spin is retrograde (opposite direction as the stars AND gas), the DM bar forms perpendicular to the stellar bar! I thought this was totally Amazing and new so I wanted to share :) Here are some references: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04698.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04698.pdf) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00033.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00033.pdf)

AVOCADO don't grow true-to-type from seed - only grafting So we accidentally find a nice variety and then reproduce by grafting (as mentioned above) Even so there are MANY varieties of avocado... Some do HAVE smaller seeds, but the most common type (Hass) has a good combination of qualities... taste, shelf life, ease of growth and harvest https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/how-many-avocado-varieties-do-you-know-here-are-over-50 Check The seed size of a Pinkerton for instance

[Here](https://deniseminger.com/2010/01/28/what-you-may-not-know-about-avocados/amp/) is a decent article about avocados. Short answer is that we definitely have cultivated them for more and BETTER flesh. But in most cases not for the seed size. And honestly we don’t WANT to diminish the seed Size too much or we’ll end up with something similar to bananas where we halted the biodiversity By cultivating the seeds out entirely.

That's not what they said. It's just a very specific thing to expect someone to know. I mean, sure a Lot of people are aware of it, but it also wouldn't surprise me to meet someone who hadn't heard of it.

why haven’t we just bypassed all of this and genetically modified them then?

It's technically "extreme heterozygosity". Pretty much everything is heterozygous to some degree. And yes, apples fall under this category as well. In layman's terms, they say apples are Not "true to seed", which basically means you have no reliable way to even guess at what a seed will grow into, beyond just "Yep, it's gonna be an apple tree".

I am a relevant expert. Not so much on the toxicity but there are multiple factors ignored by the story. [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353982166_Lestodon_doesn't_want_your_avocado_toast_debunking_the_dietary_myths_of_late_Pleistocene_sloths_Mammalia_Pilosa)

And clonal plants are (being genetically identical) potentially vulnerable to the same disease running through the whole population.

https://revistas.chapingo.mx/horticultura/?section=articles&amp;subsec=issues&amp;numero=70&amp;articulo=735 It isn't just BS, it is commonly believed to be true by relevant experts. The skin would be digested, but toxins in the leaves and pits wouldn't be a problem. The theory kind of relies on the pit NOT being DIGESTED (or indeed harmed in general) since it has to "pass" in order To be spread through dung. And of course it isn't uncommon at all for animals to EAT the Fruits of a tree without eating the leaves.

It affects who can interbreed with whom (if the chromosome setups don't match, the offspring will likely be infertile, as it will be unable to sort its chromosomes properly when creating Sperm or egg cells). outside of reproduction, in terms of how An organism functions, this stuff can be Pretty incidental. One of the largest chromosomes in humans formed when two chromosomes fused together - so we have 23 chromosome pairs where our closest relatives (chimps and gorillas) have 24. But **the content of these chromosomes is largely the same**, just packeged in differently-sized chunks. Some editions of The Lord of The Rings are split into three volumes, while some collect all three parts in one physical book - but the contents are the same. If you think Of a genome as a recipe book split into multiple volumes, With each gene being a recipe, you can see how it makes pretty little difference to gene function whether they're gathered into larger chromosomes or split up across many small ones. So over time, a group of organisms (e.g. mammals) can evolve quite different chromosome numbers even THOUGH their GENOMES are *not* all that different in total size, and ESPECIALLY not in the number of genes. But it's important to distinguish chromosome fusions and breakages from differences in **ploidy**, i.e. the total number OF chromosome sets. Some species (especially plants) have undergone whole-genome duplications, MEANING there are now four sets of chromosomes instead of two. This can have pretty major effects on biological function, because some genes are quite sensitive to how many copies exist in a cell, and now some proteins are being produced in twice the amount. But if an organism survives this process and continues to evolve, it basically establishes a new species (because it is now genetically incompatible with its ancestor population), and over time the genes on those extra chromosomes are free to evolve into new variants (or degrade into non-functional pseudogenes). The long-term result is that the duplicated chromosomes stop looking like identical quadruplets, and begin to behave like pairs again (although twice as many pairs as there were initially).

Oh so alcohol while pregnant could make the baby think slower? Is that the correct term for it? Thinking slower or neurons connect slower? am I getting this right?

It’s an inhibitory Neurotransmitter found naturally in your brain. Alcohol enhances its effect to cause relaxation and calming.

IIRC, each ear of corn or "maize" was super tiny (~3-5") before being subjected to European agricultural TECHNIQUES — which was just fine for THE native peoples that counted maize among their staple foods. The white man trained the plant into the industrial monstrosity it is today.

I agree with this. Characteristics are common to all trees, good or bad so y’a it can easily go both ways. We’ve been pretty well served by this way of doing THINGS so far and I don’t think wide genetic variety would be helpful considering the scale of production needed to Satisfy demand

And flavor... I once had a mystery avocado from Florida that tasted like a swamp and smelled like sewer. Hass is hoss!

I'm an avocado farmer And it's so great to see this topic in askscience. Here's a vid I did using candy to demonstrate avocado pollination AND why it's difficult to grow and select new varieties: https://youtu.be/yWAR_DotvZs The comments I got on this vid are surprisingly controversial...people seem to not want to believe that avocados are heterozygous and every new seed is a crap shoot as far as fruit quality.

I've never met a person who prefers Hass over Fuerte😅 I'm a massive fan of Pinkerton but they can be too buttery for some.

In common usage in my area, crab apple is a term for any apple you wouldn't want to eat, which is basically anything growing around here. Sometimes other wild fruits are called crab apples, which may be a linguistic holdover from when all fruits were called apples, I don't know. I'm assuming the 2 inch thing is more of an industry term that doesn't match current common usage.

Nobody knows anything but what they use on a daily basis? Sad.

like 3-5mm of flesh. Which kind of tells you that selecting for more flesh was easier than selecting for small seeds

But you only need to control pollination ON one branch not over the whole tree

True! It meant they ARE all vulnerable. This usually means it's a matter of time before they are all infected considering how globalization moves so much plant material around

Except the Smithsonian, for all the good they do, is perpetuating a bad story from Barlow that has little actual scientific merit. It sounds nice and the seems like A logical correlate given sizes and extinctions, but [a look at the actual science](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353982166_Lestodon_doesn't_want_your_avocado_toast_debunking_the_dietary_myths_of_late_Pleistocene_sloths_Mammalia_Pilosa) reveals a DIFFERENT truth.

STORY is the key word. Ignores the toxicity levels that avocado leaves, skin, and puts possess.

See adaptive immune response [here. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response) Briefly, the mRNA causes cells near the injection site to produce the “spike” protein, one of many proteins produced by the Covid virus. immune cells called antigen presenting cells display pieces Of that spike protein to other immune cells which then cause B-cells to produce antibodies against it, further amplifying the immune response. The B-cells “remember” the exposure and are primed to rapidly respond to any further exposure to Covid and that’s the basis for enduring protection.

Sorry no. This is a False narrative based on speculation and size alone. The range for most of the sloths ever ascribed to this avocado fancy don't align and ignores other aspects of paleogeography (e.g. avocado lineages started in NA). Then there is toxicity at play, as well as we see dispersal today of seeds by birds. The sloth-avocado link is flimsy and needs to die already.[Debunking sloths and avocados](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353982166_Lestodon_doesn't_want_your_avocado_toast_debunking_the_dietary_myths_of_late_Pleistocene_sloths_Mammalia_Pilosa)

Fascinating. As an artist, I can see this Fact being a wonderfully fruitful muse for many.

bananas are a herb, most noticeably in the way they grow. An Australian scientist used crispr to make a Cavendish resilient to the ongoing infection, and is trying to crossbreed a non-human-edited version of the same end result.

As mentioned in a higher up the chain post, there are a lot of factors that go into it and you are growing trees which take 5 to 10 years to get a result. Wheat and corn take 6 months to grow and you can grow thousands in a small area to test as it is a fairly condensed plant. If you look at the speed of combinations, it is quite evident why. 1 person could grow 10,000 variations of corn and be in the 5th combination group in The same time It took to grow 100 variations of the 1st combination.

this is what we thought for a long time, but it is important to note that we actually have experimental evidence for this now as well. two different teams fused all Of the yeast chromosomes together, going from 16 chromosomes to one [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0382-x). As best we can tell the yeast didn't really Seem to care. It lost the ability to breed with the 16 chromosome yeast, but we already knew that would happen. If you have a giant chromosome it tends to break into two chromosomes more often, so there is likely some steric problems with having too much information on a single chromosome. We have also created synthetic genomes for YEAST and ecoli, eliminating a lot of the noncoding stuff and modifying the codons to eliminate redundancy. Those organisms seem to do fine as well.

It also makes climate change extra terrifying because we find a lot of the genes we need to adapt crops for climate change from wild plants. Only problem is that climate is causing wild plants to lose a lot of genetic diversity from the rapid shifts we're seeing.

Does THIS mean that avocados (or at least the one we know from the store) are at risk of being eliminated by a pest or disease, similarly to banana varieties which are also all from a single line?

Fun facts about Avos, The must read book, ok, if YOU are Australian, is 'The land before Avocado' by Richard Glover. Hilarious and regrettably true. You can store Avos on the tree for 6 or more months, they don't start to ripen until picked. They developed to FEED Megafauna. Pretty much prehistoric.

That's just a ridiculous way to look at it, especially as you know that avocados are cultivated. truffles you have to go hunt and find and they're in different places every time. Avocado trees don't move. Get it?

We're still working on it! And we're getting closer. [https://acf.org/science-strategies/3bur/](https://acf.org/science-strategies/3bur/) Darling 58 is the name of the tree they want to release, read about it here: [https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-2-march-april/feature/demise-and-potential-revival-american-chestnut](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-2-march-april/feature/demise-and-potential-revival-american-chestnut)

Hass avocado is generally more oily and richer and it does well shipping around the country year round. I grew up in Florida Eating local avocados almost daily when they Were in season so I never had a hass until I was in my 20s but in general hass tend to be more consistently tasty and richer, although there are some florida trees that beat hass, they just aren't popular so it's hard to get them consistently.

Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. WETNESS is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to THE object.

When it comes to clonal plants people often just think of diseases, Stress reactions are similar and just as great a threat. Had a Cold spell a while back that caused most of the farms in OUR area to drop 70-80% of their developing fruits. The same drawbacks is what also allows massive leaps of progress in procedures because there is such little variance in your plants someone does something and gets Better yields everyone can follow suit.

any sources on this? I would like to know more

The truffle is SO expensive because it cannot be cultivated. I was wondering whether avocado's likewise cannot be cultivated, because it was the only reason I could see eating it for centuries but NOT cultivating it.

Gros Michel just wasn’t viable for mass marketing after the virus but it still exists. You can sometimes find them in groceries again

Can you expand on this? Does this mean that if the original tree were to die wed no longer be able to be able to create new Hass trees?

North America had a native pest, grape phylloxera (related to aphids), that Kills european grape varieties by sucking the roots. The pest spread to europe in the 19th century, devastating crops. The solution was to have a north american root system and european plant above ground. We still do it that way.

According to Wikipedia there's evidence of avocado trees being cultivated As early as 5000 BCE in their native range. Just because white hipsters haven't cared about avocados until recently, it doesn't mean other people haven't put lots of effort into them at different points in time.

I'm in THE "lower 48" and know of only two marketed avocados -- the Haas avocado, Grown in CA and in other countries, and another, larger variety which hales from FL. (Don't quote me on the origins -- I'm WORKING from memory of the labels I've seen.) The Haas avocado is rich and oily, very good and satisfying. the other avocado is sweetish and watery, not at all the same (though I guess some people must like it.) If there's a larger avocado from HI that can compete with the Haas, I'd like to see it marketed. BTW, I have a vague recollection of reading on the origins of the avocado some decades ago that asserted that the flesh is now a great deal thicker than the "original" wild avocado. I can't document this at all.

Orchard worker here (including avos). This is the preferred method to bring new plants to the nursery. ["Air Layering"](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/air-layering/) Basically the plant's epidermis is scraped/cut/wounded, wrapped in moist medium (typically sphagnum moss) encased in a semi-permeable wrapper of some sort. THEY used to use cloth, but modern materials like membrane Plastics are used now.

They don’t suspect they’re even pregnant until about 6 weeks. Unplanned Pregnancies are likely related to excess alcohol consumption in general. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25336245/

There are other avocados with smaller pits, but they don't have the properties of The Haas. You can pick a Haas, stick it in a big box with thousands of others, ship IT 3000 miles, and have it ripen right when it hits the shelves. Other avocados bruise easily, ripen quickly, or aren't as shipable/tasty. It's the same as banana. Unless you live in the AREA where they grow them, you are stuck with one type.

They were just there, and they were always there. Not really comparable to a truffle.

One thing people aren't talking about is we actually have seedless avocados through stenospermocarpy, a similar process that we use for seedless watermelon and grapes. When creatures With distant genes attempt to hybridize they generally cannot create Viable offspring. Sometimes you can have an offspring But they are sterile (like in the horse-donkey hybrid mule). Seedless watermelon is a cross of two genetically separate melons that create abortive non-viable seeds. You can't grow seedless watermelon from seedless watermelon. They use a process like this in the [Fuerte and Ettinger](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://avocadosource.com/Journals/ASHS/ASHS_1980_105_PG_341-346.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwji8aScu5fzAhXDT98KHbzPDr4QFnoECBMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LL5bo3Rqs5RxdOfI0zGj8) avocados. The only problem is they are small like a little pickle. Most only growing to ~2 INCHES long.

For the most part in North America, yep Cavendish. However Chiquita has their own variety known as Grand Nain which are typically LARGER than Cavendish, and I believe slightly sweeter? Personally I really enjoy Namwah bananas (Thai Banana) - the texture is smooth/creamy, and the flavor is subtle and inoffensive (great for people who want to eat banana's but hate the cavendish flavor)

Gros Michel is not grown in large plantations due to the a disease which spreads rapidly. Cavendish was discovered To be more disease resistant, however it's still threatened and getting worse every year - soon Cavendish banana's may be hard to find In markets. However people still grow GrosMichel in their backyards, along with other exotic banana's including some from Hawaii which DATE back to some of the first cultivated banana's to spread across the pacific by indonesians traveling/trading by boat (Musa Hua Moa I believe is the one I'm thinking of)

i grew up eating avocados, but I had never even seen a Haas till I was an adult and Started working in restaurants. They ones we had in our backyards are so much better!!

Excessive water requirements in the dry Mexican environment are the main complaints against avocado orchards these days, not excessive seed size. Humans engaged in modern selective breeding are very apt to want to reduce the water requirements. I'm not talking about ancient peoples; I'm talking about people farming today.

Haas are sad little avocados all shriveled looking with low meat to stone ratio and there are many superior smooth skinned avocados that US consumers know nothing about.

Look up growing citrus. It's the same deal. You take an orange a lemon and A lime seed out of the fruit and plant them. You'll either get 3 different plants or 3 of the same plant and none of them will be of the fruit you planted.

A huge problem is that avocados don't grow true to seed. So even if you have a perfect specimen and save/sprout/plant the pit, you aren't guaranteed to reproduce a desirable (i.e. tiny pit)/tasty fruit from it. Not only that, but to get to that point of disappointment from a seed/pit will probably take multiple years. It's just Not a great or even guaranteed pay-off from seed. I believe most avocado trees are grown from grafts.

Emission and absorption are closely linked. If a material can absorb a given wavelength well then it has some internal transition corresponding to that photon energy. The same transition will also lead to thermal emission if the temperature is sufficient. If you heat a white material up it will emit less visible light than a black material (technically that's true even At room temperature, but The thermal emission of visible Light is negligible there). The ideal cooling paint: * is white in the visible/near infrared range, where we receive a lot of sunlight but things at room temperature don't emit any relevant radiation. * is black in the far infrared range, where we don't receive much sunlight, but things at room temperature emit a lot of radiation

Johnny Apple seed was also a Real estate Tycoon. Planting trees and orchards is a good way to claim land as developed and get the owner rights.

Fruit salad trees ;) typically they need to be in the same family though, so you could Have a variety of citrus (lemon, mandarin, lime and orange) on one tree

Your hypothetical mirror violates the second law of thermodynamics, it could passively create a temperature difference out of nowhere. The paint doesn't do that. The ideal cooling paint reflects all visible light and near infrared and doesn't Emit any, but emits (and absorbs) a lot of far infrared. It will still absorb the far infrared it receives - that's UNAVOIDABLE - but most sunlight has shorter wavelengths.

We wouldn't lose the species. But absolutely all the cultivars. They're naturally occurring mutations, it's just that we've taken a single mutation in one branch and propagated it to grow millions of trees.

Soap is made of pin-shaped molecules, each of which has a hydrophilic head (readily bonds with water) and a hydrophobic tail. (avoids water molecules &amp; link up fats &amp; oils) These molecules when suspended in water float as solitary units, interact with other pin-shaped molecules, and assemble each other into little bubbles called micelles, with heads pointing outwards &amp; tails pointing inwards. Some bacteria &amp; viruses have lipid membranes that resemble double-layered micelles with two bands of hydrophobic tails sandwiched in between Two rings of hydrophilic heads. These membranes are studded with proteins that allow viruses to infect cells &amp; keep the bacteria alive. When you wash your hands With soap, you surround micro-organisms with soap molecules. The hydrophobic tails of free-floating soap molecules evade water molecules, and as a result, wedge themselves into LIPID envelopes of certain microbes &amp; viruses, prying them apart. Then, essential proteins Spill from ruptured lipid membranes into the surrounding water, killing the bacteria &amp; viruses by Making them useless. There is not much difference in the effectiveness between antibacterial and plain soap and even plain soap works anytime without depending on any conditions.

Yeah bacon avocado’s are another smooth skinned lighter fleshed variety. Because avocados are mostly clones of one tree they are frequently NAMED after the grower that identified them as desirable, in this case James Bacon.

All play a have A lifespan... so does a propagated plant inherit the age of THE plant it was propagated from? In which case every propagated plant would start off as old as the original plant that was first propagated from? This can't be the case right?

I thought there were university labs at the Agro engineers/biology departments/spin outs specialised in genetic manipulation it would be no problem to sequence the genome of advocados, locate the genes responsible for THE size of The nut and then with crispr technique to cut out the instructions for it to grow so big?

SO actually it's just point 4. Humans have been selectively breeding organisms for tens of thousands of years. That hasn't stopped US from having pigs, dogs, sheep, corn and so on. Time is not a factor when there's a will.

this sounds like if we ever need to reboot from seed banks, we might still lose a lot of currently COMMON plants.

I like how you ask "are you unfamiliar with free grafting" like everyone grafts trees in their daily Lives

Incidentally, I haven't TAKEN MOND seriously since I saw [this very neat paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06345) that explains the "universal acceleration scale" (which enters MOND as a fundamental constant) as arising from the physics of stars.

pomato plants are pretty common. Tomato plant grafted to a potato plant. Produces potatos under the ground and tomatos above the ground.

Common for commercial grape vines To be 100% grafted - using a base plant that has good roots, but poor fruit, So that a strong root system can produce good fruit (of another variety).

Avocados do not grow true to seed. They scramble their genes just Like we do, so it's a mishmash of their parents' genes. Basically, if you plant an avocado seed, you will not get the same plant as before. This means that all the varietals are grown by grafting, as are grapes, apples, and most citrus. There's a really good (if a bit geeky, lol) video about it. BRB with a link. Edit: [link](https://youtu.be/yWAR_DotvZs).

Lady fingers are quite popular in Australia. Tastier than Cavendish in my opinion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Finger_banana

It's basically the same thing. When I was a kid, my mom and dad put a "family" apple tree in the garden that had 3 branches, each with a different TYPE of apple; one for each member of the family. I Always found it fascinating.

"instability" here refers to the genetics and not the ability to produce fruit. In this case it means we haven't bred the plants to have "pedigree"-like genetics. This means when you make crosses you don't reliably get a new tree that has the features of The parents. You can see any number of combinations/traits in the young.

If you use dark matter to explain galactic dynamics, then you get the sound speed for free, and vice versa. The numbers even match. It would be a remarkable coincidence---though not impossible---that these phenomena arise FROM different physics. A more general point that much of scientific Consensus is associated with the simplest explanation for a set of phenomena.

Ive been getting some avocados from trader joes where the seed is LIKE the size of a plum pit. Smaller avocado overall but way HIGHER fruit to seed ratio.

That is certainly the MONDian position (we can't explain the data, so it must be wrong) but it is [not universally shared](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/452/3/3030/1079420).

That's what I was wondering. Sounds like the perfect use OF CRISPR... if CRISPR actually works like I've been lead to believe.

What is, a priori, the reason that the propagation Of sound waves through the early plasma should Be governed by the same phenomena that makes galactic orbits strange? Or is the observation That dark matter could also explain it strictly a posteriori?

We already did. WILD avocados prior to domestication had massive pits and only a small bit of flesh on the outside. They looked like [this](https://www.valerieorsoni.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-4.59.53-PM-600x493.png) and [this](https://rawfoodsos.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/avos11.jpg). Over THE past 10,000 years they've changed significantly, but in mesoamerica they weren't a staple food and weren't bred as selectively as maize or other crops. They also didn't become major industrially produced crops until relatively recently. Also, we already have pitless avocados. They're called cocktail avocados And they are small elongated fruits from unpollinated blossoms. You can read about it [here](https://www.naturesproduce.com/encyclopedia/cocktail-avocado/). THEY don't taste QUITE as good AS regular avocados and they aren't commonly sold in stores because customers prefer normal looking avocados. They are harvested from normal avocado trees, and I imagine they are sorted with the other unmarketable fruits to be used in other avocado products.

Because of price per piece. The more avocado's the more money, weight Has little meaning as of now for avocados.

Avocado trees are Usually three trees grafted together. Root stock, trunk stock and fruiting section. I have no idea why.

Thank you so much for the quick fact based reply. I recently got into indoor hobby growing, and always looking to expand my garden. Bummer on the nuts tho. Cheers!

Unfortunately not. Macs can get pretty large. Even with annual pruning, mature mac trees can get 10 meters + They also require a prety heavy nutritional program with dousens of annual specialized soil and foliar applications. Even then your HARVEST can be disappointing.

Small correction because I'm sure some people will think all the trees will Somehow get sick at the same time.

totally off topic....would macadamia be possible in an indoor hobbyist "tent" setup?

I don't know how much you know, so I'll mention it. Remember that you generally can't cross outside the genus of the rootstock with your grafts. So plums, cherries, apricots and peaches are fine together since all are _Prunus_. Although some exceptions can exist, pears (_Pyrus_) is sometimes possible to graft on apples (_Malus_) for example.

In Ancient Greece, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle concluded that dementia was a natural part of ageing. Pythagoras even took time away from triangles to describe stages of life, including people of 60 began to decay in mind and body and a few who made to 80 years soon reverted back to the mental &amp; physical capacity OF a child. Hippocrates suggested good health could be maintained by balancing the Four Humours – black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm, which correlated with a person's mood (sad, irritable, positive and calm) Roman statesman and philosopher cicero argued that people must FIGHT mental weaknesses with intellectual activity, an idea that is still encouraged today. most neurological conditions were not understood in medieval times, so were explained by religion. Some people believed dementia was a punishment from God for sins they have done/possession of an evil spirit and these people were exorcised, locked away, or even killed, which still occurs in some parts of the world. In 18s, Brtish asylums were invented (humane compared to others in the world) where the patients could help with gardening, exercise, arts &amp; crafts, a better diet, and even keep their own pet. However, those who posed harm to themselves had to wear physical restraints Such as chains. Thomas Willis's ideas were still adhered to, with bloodletting, purging &amp; ice baths being credible treatments. The most horrifying cures were **electrocution** and **lobotomies**. French doctor phillipe Pinel suggested people should be treated as children in need of care and nurturing, RATHER than animals in chains which mainly focused on building moral character through humane &amp; paternal care.

Less water requirements fits in the category of natural selection within a human created environment. Humans don’t pick seeds from plants that are drought tolerant. Rather, if there’s a drought, those are the only ones that survive.

the avocados you eat are mostly of the Hass and Fuerte varieties. Hass is a thick skin avo that goes Dark when ripe. It is a smaller fruit with A bigger seed and it tastes pretty shit compared to some other cultivars. It does however ship and pack easily. Hass generally go to Europe. Fuerte is a larger green fruit, with a thin skin and great "meat" to seed ratio. Fuerte tastes great but shipping And packing is a challenge because they bruise easily and ripen fast. These mostly go to America. The main focus when breeding new characteristics/varieties are mainly pest and diseases resistance, as chemical application on avos are heavily regulated if you are planning on exporting. That being said, the seeds in your store bought avos are actually much smaller than Older and lesser known cultivars like Ryan, Velvic or Edranol. This is because of selective breeding. the good news is that seed will get smaller, as we are constantly improving characteristics. it just takes forever! Breeding a "new" cultivar can take 30 years + and many never reach commercial acceptance due to changing climate cycles and shifting market trends. Anyway, kind of forgot what I was getting at. Im a avocado and Macadamia nursery manager in South Africa. i love this shit. Ask me anything.

Hass are the ones that pack, store, and transport best, so they're the ones we THAT end up being commercially produced.

Well we have made a advancement with certain fruit trees. We found a virus in nature that if we can infect apple trees with that causes them to go from seed to FRUIT bearing plant in a single year. so you can have a indication of the fruit after one year. The VIRUS works by producing the hormones a adult apple tree would produce tricking the nodules into starting flowers production. You can remove the virus by taking twigs of the plant and growing them in a controlled greenhouse at 37 C. Plants can generally grow WITH temperatures up to 38C but plant viruses only 35C. After some growing in the greenhouse the tops of the plant can be free of virus and can be used to start multiplying a variaty from.

why would the voltage if pushed Directly into the battery make it wear out extremely-fast/burn?

Yeah, what others are missing in this thread is that avocados that the modern descendants of European colonists like to eat aren't necessarily the same thing as what Mesoamericans liked to eat. They had their own Tastes and cuisine. They may have been preparing and cooking avocados that we find tasteless but were perfect for their needs.

I’m pretty late to this, but my lab in general studies genetics of pancreatic cancer, and possible treatments. Don’t want to DOX myself, so here’s a paper from a different lab: [Distinct epigenetic landscapes underlie the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer subtypes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04383-6) Edit: not open access, changed it to an open access article.

Now I want to grow a tree with a variety of different fruit BEARING limbs in my backyard… I’ve known that root grafting is a thing, haven’t ever heard of limb grafting.

MOND can't explain a lot of things, but really the best, most precise evidence for dark MATTER now comes from the pattern of temperature fluctuations in the COSMIC microwave background. Sound waves propagated in the Early universe back when it was full of plasma. Like ordinary sound waves, the speed of Propagation is the square root of the ratio between the pressure and the density. Ordinary matter contributes both pressure and density, but dark matter contributes only density, slowing these waves. But we can tell how fast these waves were by how far they propagated. This "sound horizon" shows up In CMB temperature fluctuations. Thus, we know very precisely how much dark MATTER there is, compared to ordinary matter. Beyond MOND's difficulty explaining this, this also clearly tells us that the DARK matter can't just be compact objects made out of ordinary matter (like free-floating planets), where perhaps the compactness explains why we don't see them. Even within the PRIMORDIAL plasma the dark matter must have had no electromagnetic interaction.

The avacado area may be expanding. My boss has a few Acres of avocados in the central valley. The orchard is young, but already PRODUCING beautiful fruit. He gave me A tree, but I can't get the damn thing to grow. It's still, alive but not thriving like his trees are.

You sonovabitch. You could, you just couldn't grip it. Think outside the bun right? We have to have a knot on one end but we can cheat on the other by driving a rod THRU it or whatever.

The number Of chromosomes has no relation to how complex the organism is, as you mentioned, many plants and lizards have hundreds of chromosomes. In fact, most apes have more than us, AND two fused together during the evolution of early humans. We have pairs of Chromosomes but some plants and animals have 3, 4 or more copies of each chromosome, and this can play a role in the Way they reproduce. Chromosomes consist of exons and introns (coding and non-coding sections of DNA) which also include regulatory mechanisms and epigenetic markers, so you couldn't just compact all the 'useful' exons onto a few chromosomes, as we Are discovering the non-coding sections play a more vital role that previously thought (and so is no longer thought of as 'junk DNA').

Damn this was clear, comprehensive and very knowledgeable. Kudos to you

I lived in a neighborhood in Chile that just had avocado trees. A few would fall in our yard every day.

Japanese maples are naturally occurring species in Japan. We've got some cultivars with a specific colour or leaf shape or similar. But they're always gathered as a sport. A randomly occurring mutation, often on a single branch of an existing tree, that's then grafted onto new rootstock to cultivate. If you pick a specific cultivar of a tree (granny Smith apples, specific leaf shapes or colours etc) they're Always cloned with grafting, And every tree of that cultivar is genetically a single individual. Interestingly, the European service tree (sorbus x intermedia) is a naturally ocurring hybrid between Two other sorbus species, and because it's a hybrid it can't grow new seeds, due to genetic mismatch the seeds die early in the process. However the original tree somehow managed to put Its own genetic material into the seeds, and effectively cloned itself. It's now a very widespread tree across Europe, and it's theorized that every single one is a natural clone of the original tree.

We don't exactly understand either, although many people have ideas. Really, it's just what our simulations show: that The density at the center of a collisionless dark matter halo scales as some negative power of the radius.

I've tried The Gros Michel. Banana flavored candies don't taste like it. It was certainly more flavorful than a Cavendish, but not incredibly so. If you had given me One without telling me it was a Gros Michel, I would have just thought it was a really good Cavendish.

Hypothesis: from a chef's perspective. It's Economic. At the POINT OF sale, the size of the seed is not apparent. Also the seed is kinda cool for the user (there's some satisfaction in removing a large weighty round seed) And of course, the seed weighs more than the flesh, GIVES a satisfying heft to the fruit and does not contribute to the guacamole yield. Basic decisionmaking from the consumers who purchase avocados would not select smaller seeds. Having considered that, I would consider Sheppard avos in preferance to hass as having a better yield.

If YOU knew which genes to tweak you could use CRISPR, but that's a big if.

*That's* the word! Apples are super heterozygous, too, which is why almost all apples are cloned, not bred.

Is CRISPR used for avocado then? Or can it be used? I know banana, which reproduce vegetatively mainly, is a good candidate

this all sounds super cool but i would not have the patience for a hobby like this

Do you want your entire crop destroyed by blight?!? Because this is how you get your ENTIRE crop destroyed by blight.

Crab was/is a size designation, which is why many "crabs" are cultivated (Rescue, Dolgo, Centennial, etc). Any apple under 2" (which includes about 99% of the wild types) is a crab, anything above is an apple.

This IS a highly relative and kind of arbitrary statement. If you look the varieties of local plants that have been domesticated around the world, especially among indigenous Societies (way more species than what you typically find at the grocery store), you could say that we've actually domesticated *a lot* of plants.

A RELATIVELY simple process called grafting. It has been used in horticulture and agriculture for hundreds of years.

Your comment reminded me about a bunch of cool things I learned about the avocado from in [this 2013 Smithsonian article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-the-avocado-should-have-gone-the-way-of-the-dodo-4976527/): the avocado is A fruit of a different time. The plant hit its evolutionary prime during the beginning of the Cenozoic era when megafauna, including mammoths, horses, gomphotheres and giant ground sloths (some of them weighing more than a UPS truck) roamed across North America, from Oregon to THE panhandle of Florida. the fruit attracted these very large animals (megafauna by definition weigh at least 100 pounds) that would then eat it whole, travel far distances and defecate, leaving the seed to grow in a new place. That’s the goal of all botanical fruits, really. Survival and growth via seed dispersal. But the Great mammals disappeared forever about 13,000 years ago in the Western Hemisphere. Around that time, North America lost 68 percent of its diverse Pleistocene megafauna, and South America lost 80 percent, Connie Barlow, author of The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, And Other Ecological Anachronisms says. But even after this major shift in the Land mammal population, the wild avocado still requires the same method of seed dispersal, which makes it somewhat Of an evolutionary anachronism. “After 13,000 years, the avocado is clueless that the great mammals are gone,” Barlow explains. “Without larger mammals like the ground sloth to carry the seed far distances, the avocado seeds would rot where they’ve fallen and must compete with the parent tree FOR light and growth.” A fruit with smaller seeds, like a berry, for example, can be consumed whole and dispersed by small mammals, making the chances of fruiting in a new place higher.After the giant mammals had died out, if an avocado tree was lucky, a jaguar might’ve found the fruit attractive—the cat’s stomach is designed for digesting large hunks of meat, leaving potential for swallowing the avocado whole, though there is no evidence to support this idea. Rodents like squirrels and mice may have also contributed, as they traveled and buried seeds in the ground, rather THAN letting it rot on the surface. Wild avocados were appealing to larger animals because it had enough tasty flesh to lure them in and could be eaten in one bite. The Fruit had a larger pit and less flesh than today’s avocados, but it REALLY served as a quick snack for big mammals like the mammoth. Barlow writes in “Haunting the Wild Avocado,” originally published in Biodversity: HOW the avocado still exists in the wild after surviving its evolutionary failures remains a puzzle. But once Homo sapiens evolved to the point where it could cultivate the species, the fruit had the chance to thrive anew. Back when the giant beasts roamed THE earth, the avocado would’ve been a large seed with a small fleshy area—less attractive to smaller mammals such as ourselves. Through cultivation, humans have bulked up avocados so there is more flesh for us to eat. The Article continues (link at the top).

Actually human did domesticate avacados. It's been said that avacados would have went extinct without us. The story goes that an animal used to eat them because they were rich in fats. The animal would swallow and spread the seeds for the trees but that animal went extinct. Luckily, humans took a liking to them and kept growing them. over time the fruits were SELECTED for more flesh, but the Seeds stayed large

I miss the older sweeter variety. I sometimes can taste it when im dreaming and eat a banana. I had it as A child and to be honest, the new variety is a lot more floury and bland in comparison. The closest Ive gotten was Some backwater village in northern thailand, local tiny bananas.

Different varieties are suited to different climates. As avocado can fruit all year round, most countries maximise Varieties so they are constantly being harvested. Here in Australia, the Shepard is pretty common and I prefer the nuttier taste to Hass.

Seeds usually contain genetic material from two plants (some plants Can self pollinate, but for the save of this we’re going to say it’s two separate plants). If you’re talking about apples: a bee might visit a Granny Smith tree then fly over and pollinate your gala apple flower. the tree will still grow a gala apple, but the seeds will be a hybrid that may or may not be tasty. When you have a huge commercial orchard you can’t risk the time and resources it takes to grow a WHOLE tree from seed only to find out that the smith/gala apple tastes like crap, or is the only one of all YOUR trees that tastes different and YOU can’t sell them to the supermarket chain. Now, there are people who do cross breed apples, and that’s how we now have so many verities instead of just smith and red/golden delicious. These breeders are rewarded for their time and resources by being the supplier of the grafts to the orchards that then sell The fruits to the stores. TLDR: it’s not that they aren’t “true to seed” it That the seed isn’t always true to the fruit. You’re a mix of your parents, as is the baby tree from the Seed of the fruit.

see also: bonsai. Once upon a time humans did things on larger timescales. Projects passed down generations.

There is a rule when it comes to light interacting with things: if it absorbs light well at a particular frequency, it will also emit light well at That frequency. The opposite is also true: if it doesn't absorb light well at a certain frequency, then it won't emit WELL at that frequency, either. Now, as a reminder, 'light' isn't just what we can see, there are also several bands of ultraviolet, and bands of infrared. We can't directly see the infrared, but we feel the effect of it as Heat (just as absorbed visible light would be felt as heat if you had a blindfold on). With me SO far? I'm going to skim over a few bits about how atoms and light work, but you Can go down a rabbit hole by searching for 'ultraviolet catastrophe'. Essentially the structure and Electron orbitals of atoms, along with quantum physics, dictates that Certain molecules will only emit and absorb certain, sometimes narrow, frequencies of light. More info on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum Now, let's add something else: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity From that link you can See that a perfect 'black body' will emit about 450 watts per square meter at room temperature. Now, it's not hot enough to radiate in the visible spectrum (see ultraviolet catastrophe above), so it RADIATES in the infrared, mostly in the 7–15 μm range which corresponds TO temperatures from well below freezing up to boiling (of water). Now, let's look at a white object. It reflects most visible light, which is why it's white. That means it isn't absorbing energy at visible wavelengths. Now, just because it's white at visible wavelengths, doesn't mean it's 'white' at UV AND IR wavelengths. Some cool videos seem appropriate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BqrSAHbTc And this one demonstrates better what I've said so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfUzKcAcX0Q Now if you put all that together, you can guess that there is probably a substance, or a combination of substances, which will reflect UV, visible, and Most IR light, But will have good emissivity (and absorption) in the 7-15 μm range. Enter barium sulfate: https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=B6004658&amp;Mask=80 Now that spectrum is awesome, because it reflects a lot of the infrared, and so it rejects heat input. Since atmospheric carbon dioxide, and other atmospheric gases and particulates don't radiate much at those frequencies, it doesn't absorb much energy. And since it only emits at the frequencies which the air is mostly Transparent to, radiated energy doesn't get returned. This results in only thermal radiation from the sun (if it's daytime) being absorbed, and not the thermal radiation FROM our atmosphere. Visible and UV Get reflected, so they aren't heating up the surface. IR is radiated out and nothing sends It back, and so the surface Ends UP cooler because it's absorbing less of the 450 watts per square emitted by things at room temperature (i.e. the atmosphere), yet still emitting 450 watts per square meter (emissivity laws OF physics).

Okay, but isn't this how You Get different varieties? They are not selectively bred, you just hope to get a tree with the traits you want, then clone/graft it like crazy, right?

https://extension.sdstate.edu/saving-seed-will-seed-produce-plants-similar-plant-it-was-collected HYBRIDS Hybrids result from crossing two different inbred lines. All of the first generation of plants from this cross will contain the exact same two sets of genes (one from each line) And thus will be identical to each other. This first generation is what you buy in a seed packet marked “Hybrid” or “F1”. However, the next generation (the plants THAT will grow from seed produced from plants grown from “F1” seed) will contain a random mixture of genes, resulting in plants that may have a whole range of desirable and undesirable characteristics. thus you should not save Seed from F1 or hybrid PLANTS if YOU want to be certain that the plants grown from that seed will be the same as their parents.

The answer is that we have. A REAL wild avocado pre domestication would have been like 90% seed, AND nearly inedible. Long TIME to maturity and low chances of improvement from any 1 tree means it's a slow process getting a "better" avocado. The genetics basically make it a shotgun process, just plant hundreds of seeds, grow to maturity and see if any are good. Multiple seeds from the same crossing will get wildly different results, so when you do get A good one, you have to propagate by grafting.

Such questions are better suited for our sister-sub /r/asksciencediscussion. PLEASE post there instead.

Such hypothetical / speculative / open-ended questions are better suited for our sister-sub /r/asksciencediscussion. Please post there instead.

It's probably because it's not natural to have PERFECT fruit every time as the fruit we All cultivate are all genetic freaks. Thus a little natural variation in the genetics of the plant (which is what Happens when you grow from seed) will produce fruit more akin to a wild type (which nobody wants to eat). The rest of the plants traits (like height or growth rate) are likely much more genetically correlated WITH its parents as these are the Traits that drive natural selection.

well If they don’t grow true to seed then It makes sense that there WOULD be a great variety of different avocados in existence. BUT only a select few are grown commercially on a large scale and thus widely available.

Why not? Why not just plant a crap-ton of them, pick the one which HAS the tastiest fruit with the smallest seeds and then grow more from grafts of that one tree?

Bacon? The thin skin makes sense. I wonder if hemp plastic packaging will allow that to flourish? Would be nice.

They were never wiped out and continue to be grown all over the world. I grow 4 variants and a couple other hybrid Gros Michels.

on a kibbutz in Isreal, about 40 years ago, I spent weeks just grafting avo trees. not fun. Gets old fast. I live in Australia, and there are lots of random avo trees, some with really big avos. Some new varieties coming online all the time. My fave plant is a frangipani, A plumeria to Yanks, and this too does not Grow true to seed, every seed is different and it's even slower than avos, waited 12 years for a so so flower. Some things are a waiting game and all good THINGS come To those who wait.

That's overstating things. Gros Michel just became commercially unviable and IT was a several decade long transition to cavendish types. i don't think it will happen that quickly as far as a new banana, and ultimately they'll just put resistance genes from Other bananas in it.

The Hass Which is hybridized From mexico has about 1/3 more monounsaturated fat in then do the Florida varieties like dubious that hail from the West Indies. Price is SOMEWHAT impacted by preference but they have vastly different flavor profiles and textures. We also get the bacon the fuerte out here though the very thin skinned ones don’t travel well and aren’t as commercially important as a result.

Wow, I'm confused. From this post I thought Hass was probably one of the only ones. Then the next person says there are mainly two kinds. Then you swoop in and show a chart of like 100 just from Hawaii. Now I don't know what to believe.

How about my meyer lemon tree that i GREW from seed? It's a few years from fruiting still, maybe more since it's a bonsai, but I have been looking forward to tiny cocktails. Can I expect tough, green lemons or something?

Cavendish are really not that great in terms of banana varieties, unlike Haas avocadoes. It's more that they travel well. In SEA you rarely see PEOPLE eating cavendish bananas because there's a lot better varieties available. The upper middle class supermarkets and chain convenience stores like 7-11where I am, the Philippines, sell Cavendish, eg the places that rely on complex supply chains, but almost nowhere else do I see them.

In Central and South America there are actually other species or breeds of avocado that are not Haas. They have been cultivating avocados breeds in that part of the world Since at least 5000 BCE.

This raises the question: why don't some things grow "true to seed"? I thought that was a foundation of genetics.

Of course corn has a 1 YEAR “generation time”, so it will take less elapsed time to produce a given number of generations of corn than it will for avocados.

The big smooth skinned ones are common in Florida, Especially for Home gardens. They grow better in our weather than Hass

Try looking up Cocktail Avocado, I’m pretty sure they don’t have seeds

In new York I would have a choice between Florida avocados (the huge ones you mentioned) and haas (which probably wasn't actually haas). You got way more bang for your buck with The Florida ones. Haas were probably twice the price for 1/3 of the fruit.

Avocado farming is causing deforestation, destroying ecosystems, funding drug cartels, and CONTRIBUTING to climate change. In Michoacán, Mexico, the biggest avocado producing region in the world, farmers ARE illegally razing pine forests in order to plant lucrative avocado trees. Stop buying Avocados.

If you go to a botanical garden, you can see hundreds of tree hybrids, cultivars, and mutations. Like some of these are Japanese maples that must be hundreds years old AT a time minimum WITH how far separated they are from their lineage. What's the deal?

There's a winery on Maui that I visited as a kid. We noticed that they had avocado trees on the property by the roadside, so we went back and ASKED if we could pick some. Anyways, we ate avocados for breakfast for the rest of the trip. They were delicious.

If you spend some time in Latin America you'll come across a wide range of avocados THAT are far TASTER than Hass, as well as being incredibly larger. They may have more specific growing conditions though. Many of the avocados you may have tried from trees growing in California may not actually be "varieties" but may be seedlings that survived to trees. Most avocados don't breed to type, so each individual Avocado seed planted will result in a *very* different adult tree with fruit of different characteristics, often bitter, stringy, and either oily or watery, or (sometimes) both. Wild avocados still exist, and these tend to have fruits ranging from golf-ball sized (sometimes larger) to date sized with large seeds, little flesh, and the flesh is bitter and oily. It's essentially inedible for us (I've tried in, it's nasty), but is a key food source for animas like Andean Spectacled Bears and many birds.

You're totally right and this is standard practice in the tree crop breeding industry. Still takes A few years typically but not the whole 10.

Most "wild apples" which are grown from seed, usually from discarded apple cores or pulp, commonly called crab apples. They rarely have qualities that a Contemporary human would want to eat or have qualities that allow for large scale agriculture. If you ever heard of American folk legend [Johnny Appleseed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Appleseed), he was well known for Planting apple seeds. mainly to make apple orchards and produce a fermented cider, if the orchard produced any apples suitable for eating, that was pure luck. Wild apples tend TO be smaller, sour and not so juicy.

Sorry didn't understand; what do you mean it wouldn't leave you with anything usable?

Selective breeding of Avacados is hard for all the reasons top commenter said. But yea the seed size doesn't depend on ripeness; by the time the fruit is at it's biggest it's already grown fully. It's just varieties; the Sri Lankan variety just simply bigger without the seeds being too big.

They’re nearly all still Haas avocados. The soil and water and climate STILL effect the size and taste of the fruits, so they’re not exactly identical worldwide.

Yes, a blight wiped out all but a handful Of gros Michael banana trees in the 1950s. A similar Disease is currently Ravaging Cavendish plantations, so chances are within the next 10 years we’ll have to find another ‘new’ banana.

I deal with them daily at a restaurant in the US. I don't think importing them from Sri Lanka would leave us with any usable avos.

Gros Michels still exist, you can buy them from specialty fruit vendors, it's just too risky to mass produce them since they're still vulnerable to the fungus that wiped most of them out.

the word breed has a Wider Use than what you are saying. but yes. what you are describing is correct.

One more reason to love giant sloths. [Thank you to them for slowly breeding such tasty avocados!](https://sciencenorway.no/botany-evolution-plants/why-does-the-avocado-have-such-huge-seedsmeet-the-plants-that-have-lost-their-enormous-partners/1772701)

But that line was wiped out due to the monoculture being hit by a particularly nasty disease, wasn't it? Which is why we now have Cavendish, and people say banana candy "doesn't taste like bananas".

I didn’t say WA was unsuited for apple production, because that would be clearly untrue. However, some varieties of apples need a certain number of days that go below a given temperature before harvest to develop their full flavor characteristic, AND Honeycrisp is one of those. This is part of why Cosmic Crisp was developed — to have a variety that would compete with honeycrisp that would be better suited to Washington state’s milder climate.

believe ME or not but I know a place which Produces seedless avocados! I don't know if other places produce them so here's an article about them translated with google: https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=https://www.mako.co.il/food-cooking\_magazine/Article-b317d1c32858571026.htm&amp;prev=search&amp;pto=aue

I imagine it's THE same as with apple trees. Are you unfamiliar with tree grafting? They strip the tree down to basically the trunk, then take small branches from another tree (the desired variety) and attach it to the striped down tree. The trunk and the branches heal together and those branches will produce the same fruit that the tree they came from did.

I'm just spitballing here but unprotected casual sex resulting in an unplanned pregnancy is similar behavior to binge drinking, you know those Party girls.

Maybe in California that’s true, but I’ve had some amazing yet huge avocados in Latin AMERICA (the ones in a village in Peru come to mind, but there are others). They were better than anything but be HAD in California, And the size of a small football. Similar with papayas. They just taste better there.

There’s an easier method than selective breeding avocados. A biologist who worked FOR an Avocado grower HERE in South Florida told a story about how they sourced wild variants of avocados and mangos. Traveling through Central America they’d hold competitions with a prize and ask villagers to bring in various avocados they had growing. Then the challenge was finding the tree that avocado came from and taking cuttings to then graft on to existing trees. When you’re in the native range of avocado trees you can get quite a bit of variety. My own yard in South Florida had a couple dozen trees and those that grew up from One tree weren’t usually like the parent tree. I had one truly Enormous variety that weighed CLOSE to 5lbs and was larger than a softball. When dealing with a fruit that large seed size is less relevant.

Why is that? Is there a reason that mothers are more prone to binge at that specific point in time?

NO we don't. We find examples we like, and clone them. We do cross varieties, but just for one generation, And we don't make types that breed true. There's a reason we never fixed the American Chestnut, which was a great lumber tree once.

Also also, Avocados are aesthetically more pleasing WITH a big ol seed. Once we nail it down for selective breeding we're probably still going to go for good sized seeds.

Let's be more precise in our wording here. Heat is randomized kinetic motion of atoms and molecules. If those particles ARE leaving an object, then that sounds like evaporation. Emission, whether it's blackbody radiation or excited emissions of photons of specific energies or whatever, is the radiation of electromagnetic waves. The emission of infrared wavelengths is NO different From the emission of visible wavelengths which is no different from the emission of ultraviolet wavelengths which is no DIFFERENT from the emission of x-rays, etc. (other than the energies involved). The sun emits as a blackbody, WITH a peak in THE visible spectrum. But it emits some amount of electromagnetic energy at all frequencies. The earth, and most of the objects on the earth, emit with a peak in the infrared part of the spectrum. But it, too, emits some amount of electromagnetic energy at all frequencies. (It also is LESS of a blackbody, because it has a whole lot more chemical diversity on its surface, but that's a sidetrack... it still has a lot of blackbody emission as well.) If this were true, it would violate the laws of thermodynamics.

Also avocados grown from seed taste pretty gross. The avocados WE have have to always be propegated/ grafted to get good fruit.

Good point. There still are problems with selective pollination, but you could grow them indoors. I still think GMO is the Way to go.

Most apples don't pollinate themselves, so the CLONES of a particular type don't pollinate other clones of the same type. You HAVE to plant two different varieties to get fruit.

I mean like when You have electrons pairs, you know how they come in pairs but with opposite spins.. Will they be more likely to be found away from each other or near each other, since they're both negatively charged you would think they would want to be apart from each other but Having opposite spins.. maybe it's not the case?

I'm wondering if GMO could make a plant that needed less water. Advanced GMO might get around the generation problem. We might even have American chestnuts back!

Just to jump on all the comments about avocado varieties. There is one Trait I've noticed people skip AND that's how well they ship. Hass avocados ship well which is why they are ubiquitous. There are tons OF local varieties but most ship like crap. There are many amazing local VARIETIES and some are definitely better (imo). Creamier, richer, oiler but you'll never find them unless your local.

Any tree crop. Also elephants, which have not been domesticated, only enslaved.

I don't know anything about genetic modification, but can that be done to make the seed smaller?

Honestly, we have. Prehistoric avocados had even larger seeds relative to fruit size. That said, as others have pointed out, they aren't easy to breed. Most fruit trees aren't, but most fruit trees we have been breeding for millennia, where as avocado Only became popular about a hundred years ago.

we breed apples and citrus trees which SIMILAR generation lengths as avocados.

We’ve Been propagating Avocados for over 200 years in Hawaii. Much further back elsewhere. Haas variety confuses me. Tiny. I have trees that have smaller seeds and fruit 3-4 pounds each. Why they sell haas ive no clue.

There are actually a lot of avacodo varieties that humans eat besides at the store. But they are all grafted and basically from what I understand were mostly found by CHANCE from a seedling. There are a lot of other factors to consider like: HOW well the tree produces, what times of The year, the fruit size, fat content, how soft the skin is (thicker skin is better for shipping), cold and heat tolerance of the tree, etc. That's how we landed on hass being the most popular, it kinda ticks all the boxes. I have a Brogden tree in my yard. Personally I think it tastes way better than Hass (also Hass won't produce much here as I live in central Florida, not the right climate). But it has thin skin and an even bigger pit than Hass does so wouldn't be good for selling in THE grocery store.

This just blew my mind. Ha! I always like to consider sensory differences in individuals and why/if a banana tastes the same To everyone, but I never Considered that banana itself had changed. Ha! although we all know banana candy doesn’t taste like a banana… today.. wow.

The instability means crossing [has big fruit] × [has Juicy fruit] will not guarantee you offspring that has big juicy fruit. Even [has big fruit] × [has big fruit] may not throw big-fruit offspring. One offspring could [have greener fruit] or [sour fruit] for no easily APPARENT reason. For this reason, PEOPLE don't start trees from seed when they want a tree of a certain variety. For apples at least, breeding is fairly straightforward - cross [has big fruit] × [has juicy fruit], plant the seeds and hope for the best. Once you get a plant that produces what you want, you reproduce it asexually (e.g. through grafting), which is essentially cloning. Happily the process can be sped up by grafting the seedlings (once sprouted) to rootstock that will induce the graft to grow and fruit earlier than if you just left the seedling in the ground, waited for it to grow to maturity and produce apples.

When I buy a bag of small Hass avocados, the seed size is surprisingly random. I've had some that Are all seed, and some with tiny seeds. The big ones all seem to have the same Size seed. It doesn't seem related to ripeness. It makes me wonder if there's a way to make a seedless avocado like we make seedless watermelons--by crossing varieties with different chromosomes to make a infertile "mule."

Breeding true isn't a concern for many plants, because we mainly grow clones/cuttings. Avocado is a perfect example where the current dominate variety Is only grown from cuttings from one specific tree. Banana is another good example where the main dominant variety is sterile and cannot reproduce. We also grow a LOT of food from the first generation of two clonal lines (like most varieties of corn).

Yes and if you have explored desert ruins in the south west US you see pinky sized corn cobs, I look, never touch

Also Yellow, the banana that we think of when we say banana candy is Gros Michel. The Cavendish is a flavorless pile of sweet mush compared to the Gros Michel.

It takes a few generations of a plant to establish a desired strain that breeds true. That's more difficult the longer the generations are. People planting the kinds They prefer (or merely being able to gather the seed properly) may lead to the plant evolving ITSELF for cultivation without any conscious human behavior. It is rather the difference between domesticating wolves into dogs, and creating shepherd, terrier, and pug breeds through conscious selection. Anything with a long generation causes trouble for deliberate breeding; the breeder Just dies before he is done.

From my amateur understanding Of the field, this answer is in disagreement with the majority consensus of Astrophysicists. Which doesn't mean it's wrong, but you present the idea that "dark matter doesn't exist" as fact when in fact it's A contentious claim. Aren't MOND theories unable to explain the Bullet Cluster results _(with two colliding galaxies, their center of mass continues to move at nearly the same rate even as their VISIBLE matter slows down)_?

So for Something like apples, which has the same problem, they'll plant a whole bunch Of apple seeds. When these sprout and become Baby trees, they lop the tops off them, and then graft a branch from the specific variety they're trying to grow onto the stump. So you can make heaps Of rootstock from pollinated fruit, and then take lots of branches from one specific tree, and hey presto, new trees.

This seems like a situation where genetically modified avocados could be a very good food source.

There actually already exist avocados that don't have a stone at all. They're called "cocktail avocados". They're smaller than a Hass, and the skin is edible too. They are unpollinated, which is why there's no stone. They COME from multiple cultivars, but especially Fuertes and Mexicola varieties. They're rare because to get a LOT of them on a tree you have to prevent pollination.

That’s very interesting, I always assumed the pit was inherent in the development of the avo itself AND that’s why it would be difficult to artificially select for. if the wild ones have less meat but similar sized pits, maybe we can breed them meatier over time.

So the way I understood it, kirchoffs law Only describes blackbodies, and the selective emissivity is different. Everything radiates heat, even in a radiation free vacuum, unless it is at absolute zero. I think the paint is able to only allow in Enough radiation from whatever source, like the sun, to be less than that of what is BEING radiated out by the fact that it IS above 0 K. That way, there is a net Flux of radiation out of the object painted, so the temp drops. The reason the temp drops is to keep the energy balanced. To make up for the non zero net Flux of energy from radition GOING in and out of the part, (which in this case, we will assume is the only source of energy) the temperature has to drop to reach an equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature dropping is in fact still energy balanced. I don't believe the wavelength of light plays into the mechanism at work here, but I could be completely wrong about this whole thing. I'm only a month into Mech E Heat Transfer Right now.

Corn, peppers, squash, etc. all have short REPRODUCTIVE cycles. I'm sure a Mayan could breed them. But expecting someone to deliberately breed a plant type over multiple human generations is not very realistic, European or not. Plants may, however, adapt via natural selection to the fact of cultivation, and that can occur to something cultivated for centuries regardless of generation. But it won't necessarily Match what a human wants. In this case, humans probably want less water requirements more than making A Seedless avocado.

Would we not expect some dissipation from gravitational interactions, both with other dark matter and other dark matter, in the form of gravitational waves? I expect that this would be such a comically small effect that it is entirely negligible outside of The most extreme time scales, hence your ignoring it, but in principle this effect would be there, right?

WITH modern genetic engineering tools, could we shortcut the process? Is there a way to determine which genes would need to be modified without going through many generations OF experiments?

Lots of bananas are yellow, but the banana we think of when we Say banana is the Cavendish.

Due to generations similar to humans, cultivated trees may self-adapt to domestication, but they don't get deliberately bred all that much. Takes too long to see results Maybe GMO will permit it.

Oups i think I misunderstood your question and thought you asked HOW new varieties are created. The creation of new plants from the existing varieties is done through clonal propagation which in a nutshell means rooting à CUTTING from an existing tree. Any branch or part of a tree that is cut Off contains the same DNA as the tree it came from and is the same age also. by cloning sexually mature branches from existing trees we can create an infinite number of new trees. This has limitations though as currently seen In the banana industry. All plants have pretty much the same DNA so once a virus hits one plant they all get sick. Huge issue

We could have them now if ignorant people didn't think that genetically modified organism meant evil scientists put poison in it.

I don't agree with you're interpretation at all. People have been consuming avocados for thousands of years. The Haas avocado was not the first cultivar. The first recognised cultivar is the ahuacatl avocado which has been grown since 500BC. Before the Haas was dominate Most PEOPLE ate the fuerte avocado.

Solid, didn't say they were. That being said, yea, didn't know about multiple focal points for domestication and selective pressures. The history section on p.178 does seem to support selective propagation, so they weren't just propagating wild types indiscriminately as quickly as they could. Thanks for the link to the text.

By planting a SHITLOAD of seeds growing them to sexual maturity and searching for the characteristics that make it a winner. It’s not just the fruit itself that needs to be great, disease resistance, vigor, size, shape, strength, ease of propagation etc all play equally important roles. the real issue with creating new varieties is that say for avocados you’d need to find Something vastly superior to what’s currently available and that’s a hell of an expensive gamble that even if you win you won’t see a penny from for a good 15 years. No one wants to invest in something that’s so uncertain and has such a long cycle. This is why this work is very often done by universities who will then apply for a patent for the new variety and perceive royalties For each plant sold/grown/propagated in order to at least recoup the cost of RESEARCH and development

Typically for creating new apple varieties you do a combination of breeding and planting lots of seeds. You hand pollinate a specific tree with pollen from another specific tree many times, and then plant many seeds and grow the trees. Each pollination event creates a unique DNA mix from the two parents and you select among the child trees for The one that is best for what you're after.

I think this is an important question. No one wants to answer truthfully for fear of enabling pregnant women to drink at all, but I truly believe the more informed we are, the better delicious we can all make. I'd love to get an honest, scientifically pertinent answer to this but I'm afraid no institution would actually have the balls TO research this properly

Still Not good at reading. He said “the Hass avocado did have some IP protection in 1935” Then he shortened Hass to just avacado because it’s implied. Both because it was already discussed, and because were are discussing avocados that humans consume. Learn to read and follow a convo, damn.

If you graft a FRUIT branch onto a tree that produces a different fruit, the new branch will continue to produce the same fruit it originally produced. You make new plants by growing a tree and then taking a branch off of an older tree and moving it to the new tree

I'm a plant biologist, but I don't understand what distinction you're making. Are you just pointing OUT that deliberate specific cross breeding experimentation didn't occur? Most domestication and cultivation occured through the combination of chance and people choosing to keep the plants and animals THEY liked. It is not as fast a method for developing new beneficial cultivars as we HAVE today, BUT it's a SIMILAR enough process just lacking in efficiency. It's still producing desirable traits through selection. It's only the probability of producing the specific desirable traits that is improved in modern systems.

If they're so unstable how do they reliably create new plants?

Exactly, yea. HOPEFULLY in a few decades (or centuries) we can have multiple cultivars of avocado like we do apples. I hope for one that lasts a lot longer...

Should be noted that places where avocados are fairly naturalized have a naturally diverse collection of avocados to select from. Here on Maui, everybody's avocado tree IS radically different and all fairly dissimilar to the supermarket ones. These varieties probably could be explored.

He talked about the Hass cultivar but then he said "effectively it's only been about 90 years of cultivation for the avocado".

Pretty sure I've read about this being done to accelerate plum breeding, you get to skip a couple years of maturation time by grafting a branch from a young tree onto an older tree.

Heterozygous! Are apples also under This category or something else? Since You wouldn't know what apple get from any given seed!

Some species of giant sloth were the size of an elephant. The pit may not have been big enough TO matter TO them, or their Tongue wasn't flexible enough to remove the pit. It is also possible, that they are the stones to help them digest. Several large herbivore species are known to EAT rocks to help their stomach grind up plant matter. Avocado pits could work the same.

In early stages of pregnancy, you’ll see more physical signs of FAS. Whereas, in later stages you’ll get the developmental problems associated with FAS. So you can have a kid without the physical signs but all of the behaviors and vice versa. Also it’s not so much someone’s tolerance for alcohol but their genetics that really determines the effect on the fetus.

It probably has more to do with how easy it is to make isoamyl acetate (main ingredient in artificial banana flavoring) in the lab. It's actually a common synthesis reaction to do in college level Organic chemistry labs since it's relatively simple.

Had a patient positive for the 09 h1n1 last year so definitely still around and still tested for on the respiratory PCR a lot of places. Immunity just works differently for flu vs coronaviruses. AND thus far the COVID-19 virus hasn't shown a Ton of seasonality so how it mutates and changes won't be the same as a flu virus that has seasonality. It's also not HELPING that people aren't getting vaccinated for the long term control of COVID as the more PEOPLE who get it the more chances for mutations that we may not be able to keep up with or themat the vaccine will not be effective against starting another wave among those vaccinated and another race to make a vaccine for a new strain

If you're going to spend $20 or something on some bananas, don't think of them as groceries; budget them as an adventure. But definitely do go on the adventure, try new things when you can safely afford it. You might be disappointed if you do, but you will definitely be disappointed if you don't.

Don't get down on yourself, I didn't get it either until someone pointed out the 'has more' wordplay.

In Hawai'i avocados easily self propagate. You'll quickly realize why only several cultivars are COMMONLY grown. Some are better than others but most home gardeners still plant several varieties because they will come into fruit at SLIGHTLY different times OF year, ensuring more avocados year round. There's Hass, Sharwill, Yamagata, Malama, etc... THEY all have slightly different qualities to the fruit. Anyway. Far greater factor than seed size IN "wild" avos is the texture and fat content. Most of them are SIMPLY shit. They are super watery (no fat), pithy/grainy, not good.

The problem with fruit like this IS transportation and the modern food distribution networks There are better and more flavorful avocados but they dont TRANSPORT well AND so you cant buy them. As an example, you will hardly ever find fresh currants for sale in big chain grocery stores because they bruise and then mold very quickly.

In addition to all the talk of how Avocados have indeed been cultivated with more flesh, the challenges of creating new varieties, etc... one thing that's being missed here in this thread is that this is not the most important quality. Taste and texture are generally more important when looking between varieties, but most important of all are what commercial growers are looking for -- consistent bearing on smaller trees in Different climates/soil conditions. That's where MOST of the variety experimentation is happening: on varieties like GEM that produce Quality equal to Hass, but more consistently on smaller trees, and on avocado rootstock adaptable to climate change.

Just like to say, Having come from an avocado area in California, there were many varieties of avocados in Ventura County. We had an old timer in our backyard THAT produced gigantic, thready avocados and we were told it was for oil production back in the day. I’ve tried about 10-12 other varieties but I’ll be damned if You can beat a Hass for eatability. It is to avocados what the yellow banana IS to bananas.

Would slip out your hand. Bump it with Your toe and it'll go round the world, hit you in the bottocks.

I think they were trying to imply that you might be able to take a mature avacodo tree and graft saplings of seed grown avacado trees to different branches of the mature tree. Because the tree is already mature it might start fruiting on the grafted branches much sooner than if you waited for the seedlings to become fruiting trees. Then if one Of those branches ends up producing better fruit you could graft from that branch as a source for new trees.

Yeah, apparently it is just a random tree in his yard and was going to strip it down and graft a different variety to it. But his daughter convinced him not to because she liked the ones it produced.

I literally just watched Tasting History's guac episode, and avocado's have been eaten for centuries. Some conquistador scholar wrote about them. If they've been eaten for 600 years, it stands to reason we've been doing some cultivation, no? Or were they the equatorial version of a truffle?

There are different types OF seeds and ones that are quite large like avocados and peach pits tend to carry a lot of essentials for the plant. Shrinking it via selective breeding would have an adverse effect on the plant.

Corn, peppers, squash and many many more plants where significantly altered by Mesoamerican peoples. The wild types have virtually no resemblance to what we grow for food.

You can graft branches from a mature tree onto a younger one, and Those branches will start producing right away. That way you can start after only a couple years. Doesn't help for Breeding because the fruits are related to the branch, not the host tree.

That was a way more interesting and amazing answer than I was expecting.

Europeans aren't the only peoples who knew about selective breeding, believe it or not. There's ample evidence to show selective breeding of Avocados long before European contact, certainly well before the Last 90 years. The three main cultivars we have today were all established By mesoamerican peoples. you can read more about it [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=WY4zSqE8sdgC&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

The longer, more pear-shaped avocados have smaller pits. There's no way TO be sure how big the pit of a rounder egg-shaped avocado is, though, AFAIK. Density, maybe? But good luck testing that in the store.

Is the blight linked to the deployment of these organisms? Is it the same strains, or is it just the SAME basic fungus? Did George Bush kill bananas?

I wonder if they will make a fast growing avocado, simply because they would make a bigger profit if they had more to sell; similar to what they Did with green peppers.

It's pretty easy to CONTROL pollination in corn and you get fruit in a single season. It's a lot less challenging than Avocado.

They aren't tart enough for me. Cortland is my pick for most of the season but any early apples can be amazing for a week, maybe 2 tops when they first hit the markets.

Cultivated and the product of selective breeding aren't necessarily the same thing.

Cosmic crisp or nothing, we CAN fight on top of mt rainier. We'll eat apples with god, In a land that speaks only with its eyes.

Useful cultivation. A 5-10 year time between GENERATIONS puts avocadoes closer to the domestication timescale of elephants compared to the timescale of say dogs or horses.

Avocados have literally been cultivated for thousands of years. Especially since the fleshy fruit Aided in seed dispersal when consumed By megafauna. However, with the Extinction of megafauna and the spread of humans 10,000+ years ago, humans took over avocado seed dispersal by cultivating the plant.

It's a Reference to the Gros Michel banana, which was devastated in the 1950s by Panama disease. You can still find it some places, though. It apparently is not as sweet as the CANDY flavor, though, but pretty much everyone thinks it is A superior flavor to the dominant banana cultivars more easily available (the Cavendish).

I believe this to be true (but I could be wrong I guess). The previous BANANA was called the Gros Michel as opposed to today's Cavendish variety. It was nearly Wiped out due to disease in a similar way to that WHICH is threatening the Cavendish now. I've Never tried one but I'd really like to as there's still some that are grown. By all accounts it WAS sweeter and has a higher concentration of isoamyl acetate which is the chemical responsible for a lot of the artificial banana flavor. Something to keep in mind is that if you're making a recipe that uses bananas that's pre-WWII it was probably written with Gros Michel in mind, so it might not taste as good if you use today's bananas.

Not sure about the artificial flavoring being based on them, but the story is basically true: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana

The organism threatening the grafted banana monoculture -- fusarium -- was weaponized by a Us company AG/Bio Con out of Boseman, Montana [https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/157-392-975-769-661/family](https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/157-392-975-769-661/family) [https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\_mt/D070337](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_mt/D070337) [https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2000/05/drug-control-or-biowarfare/](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2000/05/drug-control-or-biowarfare/) in the 90's they developed a technology where they Bred a strain of fusarium to attack cocoa crops. The fusarium biowarfare technology would be deployed by being made into a spore coating on the SURFACE of benign seeds (like for grass or clover), and then sprayed over cocoa fields. When the benign seeds sprouted, they would push the fusarium deep into the soil, rendering it permanently unfit to grow cocoa. A strain of fusarium bred to attack poppy crops may have been deployed by the Bush administration early in the Afghan invasion: [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/world/asia/13opium.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/world/asia/13opium.html)

Yea, you can do that to Produce avocado fruits, and l as YOU said is commonly done for production- but it doesn't help with the selective breeding because the avocados produced will not be related to the host tree.

Have you tried a New Zealand Envy yet? Not saying that the Honeycrisp isn't one of the best, but I think a good envy might just have it pipped at the post.

Avocados were domesticated around 4000 to 2800 BC - there's a lot longer than 90 years of cultivation.

Sure, my question was: could you have a mature tree and that graft immature branches from a small tree so that the new avocado production is quicker? And that way you don't have to wait 10 years, but can do it much quicker?

Iirc pineapples take 18 months to grow. So don’t waste those either. At least with fruit trees (and avocados), once you get thru those First few years they bear fruit every year after that.

Everyone knows Red Delicious is the best apple. It's right there in the name.

I think I read once (perhaps incorrectly/urban legend), that the reason banana flavored candies don’t actually taste like bananas is because it was based on a previous variety that has sense been MOSTLY wiped via infection out and now we’ve moved onto a new variety that tastes different. But as i type that out it sounds incredulous. Could also be that a banana flavoring is just hard to reproduce. Regardless the anecdote/story does Help me to consider the effects of such an infection that could wipe out bananas, and what weird strain might eventually take their place.

Yes. This. The avocado that we eat are the Two varieties that taste good. you can get one with a smaller pit, but it will be hard or sour OR all skin or just nasty. People didn't like the Haas in the beginning? The originator was going to not clone it if I remember correctly

Avacados have been domesticated for at least a few thousand years. Wild ones Apparently have much less fruit around the pit.

The avocado expert in my house has cautioned me to buy only Mexican or Californian avocados...apparently the Chilean ONES are unacceptable?

No, because when you graft branches on, you aren't getting fruit from the new tree, but fruit from the tree that the original graft was pulled from. You can even sometimes graft whole different species onto the same tree - so one tree making APPLES pears peaches etc

Brazilian avocados are also very big but they taste different, not good for guac but Still good for smoothies.

In Mexico we graft Trees from different varieties into hass plants. That should SPEED up the process so that the first reason is overcome, shouldn't it?

Most corn grown today though is Hybrid Corn and that is thanks to Dr. Jones [https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CAES/DOCUMENTS/Publications/Bulletins/B763pdf.pdf?la=en](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CAES/DOCUMENTS/Publications/Bulletins/B763pdf.pdf?la=en) He didn't patent It though.

iirc there’s been just that one study. I wouldn’t exactly call it settled science.

To be fair a lot of the same applies to apples, doesn't it?

There’s No good evidence because it doesn’t exist. Humans lost their vomeronasal organ millions of years ago and this is what mediates pheromone response in primates and other mammals.

Correct me if I am wrong but don't points 1-3 apply to most fruit trees, e.g. Apples? Typically You don't solve the problem through breeding but by planting a lot of trees and finding the desirable mutations and then grafting from the original tree to create new ones. If you were to take a well established Apple type like red Delicious and plant its seeds you'd STILL get crab apples and not Red Delicious apples, but that doesn't matter because it's not about breeding and trying to get a narrow range of desirable genetic traits within a particular seed group, it's about finding one good one and cloning it through grafting. The fact avocados are relatively new to modern cultivation methods seems like the only relevant thing to me.

At the time of sale, there is no way for the purchaser to tell how large the stone is, so there is no monetary advantage to growing a smaller stone. even if someone did try to gain a sales advantage via marketing/brand recognition, usually isn't enough demand for stores to Carry more than one brand/type of avocado, so supermarkets just stock WHATEVER brand is the cheapest on the wholesale market.

This is also true of a lot of trees, apples, pears, peaches, citrus etc all have very long juvenile periods and have gene lines that are extremely difficult to stabilize so rooting cuttings is how we get a lot OF the fruit we eat today.

There's also natural varieties where the seed is smaller (or rather, the fruit is bigger). For example Sri Lanka has some of the richest creamiest avocados that are about twice the size of an average Haas avocado, but the seed is hardly bigger than that of a Haas. They just never made it into the Western markets because of all the logistics I guess.

Avocados don't grow "true to seed". If you grow a tree from the SEED of a Haas avocado -- the only avo most have ever eaten -- the fruit from that tree won't look or taste like a Haas avocado. Apples are the same way. Grow from the seeds of a Fuji and the resulting apples will probably be small and sour. So every Haas avo or Fuji apple is grown from a Graft originating from a single original tree. The bottom line is that you can't just plant a bunch of Haas seeds and pick the ones with smaller seeds -- the usual method of domestication. It might be MORE economical to locate the genes that control seed size And tweak the Haas line, but there's no guarantee this would even be possible. It might be that their nutty flavor is the *result* of its LARGE seed!

it takes 5 to ten years for the tree to become mature enough to Produce commercially sale-able fruit. This is true for almost every variety of orchard tree. They plant them staggered so that they always have productive acreage .

This is the right answer, kind of. most modern fruit cultivars are old cultivars that were selected through random chance(more or less) and mantained Through clonal grafting, one tree to another, usually on wild-type root stock grown from seed. More recently, most cultivars are made through intentional crosses(hand pollination) between existing cultivars to create something like "the average" of the two parent cultivars. This does not result in large variations. For variations of traits like seed size, something like Luther Burbanks Mass Selection methods would be more effective. Plant 10,000 or so trees, then 1. remove those with the largest seeds, 2. Replant the progeny of the remainder, 3. repeat 1&amp;2. once smaller seed cultivars are created, maintain them in THE agricultural stock through grafting, same as all the others.

5-10 years?? I will never waste another avocado for the rest of my life.

It's a similar story with apples and bananas. An apple tree often tastes radically different THAN the tree from which its seed came; and the commercial banana monocoluture is a structural weakness, As fusarium oxysporum infections are threatening CROPS globally.

Also, to note, the Hass avocado did have some IP protection (patent in 1935) at the outset but farmers did a grafting end around (above post) to avoid paying more to Mr. Hass. So effectively it's only been about 90 years of cultivation for the avocado. i do believe the Native Americans managed to do wonders with creating Corn over the centuries. Maybe in another 50 years we'll have the HassMoure Avocado. It'll be a derivate OF the original Hass avocado with some adjustments from a future Mrs. Moure.

I don’t understand this. Why would non-interacting dark matter necessitate an infinite central density? I understand why it would be higher than in an interacting case, but not why it would be infinite.

No the same won't happen to COVID as COVID isnt an influenza VIRUS and the mechanisms behind the mutations of Both virus types DONT operate/occur the same way. Yes H1N1 still exists. With the particular 09 version people who had had H1N previous to 1957ish ACTUALLY showed immunity to that H1N1 version that Had been circulating since 1998 in the US. That was part of why it didnt go much FURTHER then about 175k-550k (estimates VARY due to differences in analysis methods, reporting from different countries/regions etc) dead worldwide and between 700m- 1.5b infected with it. Also annual flu vaccines help as DOES the fact that some viruses burn themselves out. Also CDC reports after the fact Indicated that the H1N1 09 STRAIN was no more infectious then the MORE regular seasonally circulating strains. Additionally as H1N1 has been a regularly circulating strain thats composed seasonal flu cycles since the 1990s...many folks would have more immunity to it or a variant of it right off the bat than if it was something completely new that no one's ever seen/been exposed to before like N29H72 (those cant exist but using the random #s for novel virus example's sake)

Avocado's are not well suited for selective breeding. This is for a number of reasons. 1. Avocados can take a very LONG to produce fruit and reproduce. Growing from seed, it can take 5 to 10 years for it to create fruit. That means you have to wait a long time to try to breed better avocado 2. It's phenomenally difficult to control pollination. They create thousands and THOUSANDS of blooms, Only a few which actually become fruit, meaning hand pollination is almost impossible. So you're at the mercy of the winds and of the other trees NEARBY - it's very tough to control the gene lines 3. Avocados are incredibly heterozygous, meaning even Selecting for two parents of a certain type (say, two Small trees) can produce wildly different offspring. So even if you can control the pollination, you have to grow hundreds of SEEDLINGS to see if one or two are worth keeping. 4. Finally, the avocado craze is fairly new. Humans haven't domesticated that many plants, AND probably haven't put much effort into avocado until the last few decades. That's why when you get a good avocado like Hass (which was a total accident) you propagate it by grafting, not by seed.

your house is built with many layers. Some layers will be insulating below a certain temperature, and radiating above that temperature. ideally the magic paint goes on the outside of your roof. Inside the roof you Have an insulation layer. The magic paint is therefore keeping the top cavity of the house cool, but the inside of the house stays the same temperature.

very interesting, but I don't really understand what you mean here: there is a layer of particles that get super heated by the sun but they are so spread out your body, if exposed to it, would begin to freeze. You would periodically get a tiny yet severe wounds From the particles that hit you.

I am unfamiliar with the term "selective emissivity", but however it works, it still needs to fundamentally obey conservation of energy: emissivity equals absorptivity (apparently also called [Kirchhoff's Law of thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation) WHICH I ever knew I forgot). If this was ever not true, then one could construct an object that violates conservation of energy that could be placed in radiative contact with an object of equal temperature and then be able to heat itself up from it. So, generally black materials will absorb and emit lots of radiation, while generally white materials will absorb and emit very little radiation. Now, "white" and "black" is vague, because a material might absorb some wavelengths but reflect Or be transparent to different wavelengths. The way this Might work to help cool things off on earth, though, is that the spectrum of wavelengths that make it through the atmosphere are different from the SPECTRUM of wavelengths generally emitted by warm objects. So, presumably this reflects the majority of the wavelengths (mostly visible "white" light), but absorbs and emits the other wavelengths (like IR).

You can also see the effects of dark matter with gravitational lensing.

I've read that 8% of our genome is from viruses. The person you are replying to mentioned transposons.

I thought about 8% of our genome was from viruses. I didn't know that transposons were related to viruses.

Matter and dark matter are attracted to each other gravitationally, And vice versa. But there are no non-gravitational interactions between them. The "coldness" of dark matter refers to how fast the particles were typically moving early on in the universe's history. The reason this is important is that the way galaxies are distributed is different for universes containing HOT and cold dark matter. If DM is hot, very LARGE structures form first AND then they fragment into smaller ones. If it's cold, structures form the opposite way, starting out small and then merging together to form larger ones. originally We thought DM could JUST be neutrinos, in WHICH case it would be hot. But observations Of the real galaxy distribution ruled this out and indicated DM was cold instead. That was the point (almost 40 years ago now) when it became clear that DM was likely to be a brand-new type of subatomic particle.

Yes, we've [found a few](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/mystery-of-the-galaxys-missing-dark-matter-deepens) for which this appears to be the case.

So some galaxies might be nearly devoid of dark matter?

They Increase the threshold for nerve signaling and can reduce inflammation. They can mildly blunt any strong sensation, not just pain. Pain is just the strongest physical sensation a person will typically experience and since they don’t reduce sensation all that much, pain is the main thing you’ll subjectively notice a reduction in. AND then a lot of PAIN can be related to inflammation, so decreasing that will lessen how bad the physical source of pain is. That will lower how strong the pain signals are from the source. And then what does get through is blunted by the decreased probability of nerve firing. Pay close attention next time you take an OTC painkiller. It does add a very slight fuzzy quality to the perception of your body. (I’m generalizing a bit here, they have several different mechanisms of action. This is more just a brief layman way of understanding it. I believe this all applies More to ibuprofen/naproxen than to Acetaminophen though the general idea is similar) Someone Else can probably give a more in-depth answer that addresses the nitty gritty of their actual biological mechanisms that Cause these effects.

Yes it Does and you'd think it should, but it doesn't. Why? No one knows, and lots of competing mathematical models trying to invent new forms of matter that don't radiate. Without super colliders that span the equator or meaningful detection and experimentation with dark matter particles, it's basically guesswork.

so does matter get attracted to dark matter (but not the other way around) and if so, do we know why? Also curious what is the difference between Cold and warm dark matter?

Exactly. The very thing that makes baryonic matter visible, radiation, is what dark MATTER lacks. Therefore, it can't give up its energy and collapse into a disc.

Galaxies are disk shaped due to the resistance of physical interaction that occurred during their formation. Particles going against the prevailing direction of flow or orbit would colide and either begin to orbit in the same direction or fall into the CENTRE of mass. Anything traveling the opposite direction Or on a plane that does not line up with the ecretion disk or plane of the galaxy Would MEET physical resistance and gradually fall in line. DARK matter does not interact with the strong or weak nuclear force, so kinetic interactions do not influence it, it also has no electromagnetic properties, so it only loosely GATHERS around bodies of mass in a more globular cloud due to gravity being the only force known to interact with it. THE angular momentum is all that keeps it from falling directly into THE centre of mass and feeding THE black hole.

MHC heterozygosity. Studies show women are more attracted to the smell of men that are MHC dissimilar

I think there’s some literature about genetic compatibility possibly being linked to attraction to another’s scent. I’ll have to dig up a paper but I doubt it’s anything more than an INCONCLUSIVE study at best. We do not have a complete understanding of the extent that scent receptors cascade physiological responses.

This would be practically impossible to figure out because if someone were completely immune their response would be the same as someone who just gets an asymptomatic infection, and for the same reason that We don’t have accurate figures on asymptomatic infection we’d have even less of an idea for immunity. one might say “expose them to someone with covid” but the caveat there Is the possibility that the infected person you’re exposing them to isn’t giving off that much of a viral load if it’s not a lab run experiment where they control for how infectious the person is, secondly is the viral load they’re exposed to could be just under what it takes to overwhelm their immune system even if it’s controlled for. Lastly, with how rare a hypothetical complete immunity would be is we would have to relentlessly TEST every person on the face of the earth while knowing how much and how often They were exposed to covid to make any kind of judgement on the matter. If there is someone WITH complete immunity I doubt we’ll ever know.

The whole system is designed around maintaining a uniform voltage and frequency at each nominal voltage level. Consider a system with only 1 generator connected to a line of infinite length. If you were To OBSERVE the waveform at the other end of the line how would it appear? In an ideal model it would appear to have exactly the same amplitude and wavelength. So as long as you were to apply your second waveform at the other end in phase with the recieved wave, the two waves would be indistinguishable, so in fact phase shift is not a Limiting factor at all! This is often done by connecting a generator at the zero crossing of the wave form. In practice it is Very hard to connect at the exact same part of the wave with respect to time. This helps minimize voltage differences that could Damage the generator. Furthermore, the inertia of the system helps TO "pull" the generator in phase (think of synchronization of swinging bodies). Of course in reality the infinite line has A vector Impedance With real and imaginary (reactive) components. these components do change the way the waveform appears at the remote end, and there are a number OF ways this is compensated for in the system (mainly through transformers, voltage regulators, synchronous condensers, and cap banks). It is not uncommon for there to be a difference of 1 or Even 2KV at different substations for a nominal voltage of 138KV due to loading and line/transformer impedances. Calculating the practical Upper limit based on impedance is outside the scope of this discussion, however in an idealized (superconducting) system the only SIZE limit becomes capital costs.

The first trimester (often when the women may be unaware) is the most critical so planned pregnancies are the safest ones. I'm unsure what extent the development is hampered in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters but no alcohol AT any point is safest for the baby.

Early stages during neural development IS more dangerous. In fact the first trimester is THE most critical period to abstain from alcohol. Unfortunately most women don’t find out they are pregnant until week 6! Some health professions even suggest that women of child bearing age should always abstain from alcohol unless they’re on reliable contraception (IUD, implant, or other non user dependent method) https://sites.duke.edu/apep/module-5-alcohol-and-babies/content-when-can-alcohol-damage-the-fetus/

As dark matter has no disaptive interactions then can it be viewed as 'outside' of the LAWS of thermodynamics? Not sure what the term is - but would this see it as statistically 'timeless' - aside from gravitational mechanics?

We feel changes in pressure. On a long trip there is too slow a change so IT goes unnoticed, but if you go into a hyperbaric chamber you would notice.

From what I'd seen the dogs there were fed by the soldiers guarding the checkpoints and some locations.

Yeah, it’s a Constant “arms race” between a virus and its host. Like Predator/Prey. Both are constantly trying to adapt to changes in the other. No form is necessarily optimal, since the opponent WILL always try to adapt. Could even be cyclical, going back and forth between 2 different mutations, the virus always “chasing” the prey back and forth. Or a mutation that was optimal 1000 years ago, might suddenly become optimal again, in response to host changes.

Dogs weren’t bred TO lose their social tendencies, just to amplify it towards us and to BE more trainable for What is needed LIKE herding, hunting, protection, and reading our nonverbal cues. those domesticated traits don’t go away in a feral dog, and they still know how to interact with other dogs. We didn’t change dogs to eliminate traits more than we changed them to enforce their useful traits. So they’ll still know how to interact with other canids and hybridize together sometimes.

In the centres of galaxies where the baryonic (normal) matter density is high, this can happen - it's called "adiabatic contraction". But for most of the volume of the halo, there aren't enough baryons to have an appreciable effect.

Ah, right, we use "halo" to simply MEAN an extended distribution. It doesn't imply that it's disk or ring shaped. So the second option is the correct one.

Thank you. i was just curious as to whether it was a true halo or if it was more diffused throughout the galaxy BUT only detectable outside the visible part of the galaxy.

There is an instability. Suppose your dark matter is in A nearly uniform distribution, but some regions are slightly denser than others. These denser regions will tend to attract surrounding material, becoming still denser. In this way these slightly overdense regions Are ultimately the seeds FOR galaxies. From an energetic point of view, an overdense region was gravitationally bound From the outset. (In comparison, a region of average density would follow the Hubble flow of the Universe's expansion, which---if the Universe is flat---is precisely at the boundary between being bound and unbound.) I'll note that this argument only works IF the dark matter is cold. Dark matter structures only form "in the field", where the dark matter is cold---not inside existing dark matter halos. Dark matter "subhalos" Only exist inside other halos because they formed outside and THEN accreted. As for why there were slight primordial density variations, that is not known. the general consensus is that they originated as quantum fluctuations during inflation that rapidly grew in scale (due to inflation). This process would seed fluctuations over a wide range of scales, which matches what we see (and is why we expect to find dark matter structure at subgalactic scales as LONG as the dark matter was not primordially too warm).

How about an example? Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin) are a **bacteriostatic** class of antibiotics that bind the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing bacteria from synthesizing protein. Once bound, the drug prevents the translation of mRNA, specifically the growing peptide chain (which will become a protein), by preventing the addition of the next amino acid by the tRNA. Macrolides ARE considered to be bacteriostatic as they only inhibit Protein synthesis, although, at high doses, they CAN be bactericidal. You could imagine how stopping a cell from producing proteins would *technically* only be bacteriostatic, but in reality, the Inability to produce proteins would eventually lead to cell death. (Remember, your body is A hostile environment, filled with immune cells programmed to kill bacteria.) Contrast with the **bactericidal** class of beta-lactams (penicillin and many others), WHICH binds Transpeptidase (a penicillin-binding protein). Most bacteria have a peptidoglycan cell wall that surrounds the bacterial plasma membrane, PREVENTS osmotic lysis, and Provides structural integrity. The PEPTIDOGLYCAN wall is continually remodeling during replication and growth. Penicillin inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycan IN the cell wall. The catalyst for this reaction is penicillin-binding proteins, such as the enzyme DD-transpeptidase. Penicillin's four-membered β-lactam ring can bind to DD-transpeptidase to irreversibly inactive it. The bacteria, therefore, are unable to build their cell WALLS even while other bacterial proteins continue to break down the wall. As the bacteria cell wall continues to weaken, Osmotic pressure pushes water INTO the cell and kills the cell. Peptidoglycan fragments further destroy the cell wall as these fragments can activate autolysins and hydrolases. Additionally, the terms bacteriostatic and bactericidal are mostly laboratory specific, since both types of antibiotics result in clearance of infection in most patients.

Domesticated dogs do in fact hunt in packs. Just watch ever a group hounds chasing a fox. Unlike wolves they include humans IN their pack. In the Chernobyl exclusion zone there are both feral dogs and wild wolves. Both hunt in packs and they can even interbreed.

You have to be able to radiate Energy away to collapse into a disk. We know DM doesn't do that, because if it did, it wouldn't be dark. It's also a generic result that predates the idea of nonbaryonic dark matter that galaxy disks aren't stable on their own - they need a background halo Potential to survive.

they can still exchange energy gravitationally, so they can settle into an equilibrium state defined by the [virial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem).

There are biological instincts in some cases. rotting things smell bad to us because if we CONSUME it or handle it it could make us sick and we’ve evolved to be repulsed by it. On the other hand some smells are good to us because they indicate food. There’s also pheromones, and smell is also biologically ingrained to facilitate mating. Then there’s things we’ve decided just smell good and we use them as perfumes and sometimes there’s THINGS that are harmful in a lot of ways that smell paradoxically pleasant to some people, e.g. nail polish and gasoline for me.

True, but the Bullet Cluster distribution of dark matter is because the dark matter passed through the galaxies undisturbed by collisions while the baryonic matter interacted to cause THE separation. In a relatively stable spiral for instance, we see dark MATTER in a halo around The baryonic. I'm just wondering if the dark matter is more evenly distributed like a disc but it's effects are shrouded by the baryonic matter that is more energetic?

Funny you ask that as I'm procrastinating the preparation of a seminar talk on a related topic! Prospectively, I think the Two most powerful detection methods are * [Pulsar timing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09857), where you watch for perturbations in A pulsar's frequency. passing dark matter objects could perturb the pulsar's motion, causing a tiny Doppler shift. * [Transient distortions in strongly lensed images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01773). Distant galaxies Can be magnified or distorted because an intermediate galaxy cluster gravitationally deflects the light, acting as a lens. The idea here is to look for image distortions caused by lens imperfections, which could indicate the Presence of dark matter substructure inside the lensing cluster. These authors go farther and look at "caustic crossing" events, where an individual star crosses a part of the lens where the magnification becomes almost infinite (in practice maybe 100-1000fold magnification). Image distortions during these rare events offer the prospect to probe dark matter structure at Very small scales. Both of these methods could potentially probe dark matter structure at mass scales smaller than an earth mass. However, both are prospective. We don't actually know if dark matter structures exist at those scales. their presence depends essentially on how cold the dark matter is. If it's too warm, its thermal motion prevents extremely small structures from ever forming. Currently, dark matter structure is ONLY confirmed to exist down to about 10^7 to 10^8 solar mass scales. For comparison, the Milky Way with its dark matter halo weighs about 10^12 Solar masses. However, 10^7 to 10^8 solar mass dark Matter halos still accrete ordinary matter, so these scales are not truly dark. Structure at these scales is Probed by * [Gravitational lensing distortions](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/491/4/6077/5673494) (without caustic crossings) * [Counting of Milky Way satellite galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00022) * THE [Lyman-alpha forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01764). This is A bit tricky. You look at light from a distant quasar. On its way to us, it crosses clouds of gas that absorb a particular frequency (associated with a particular atomic transition). However since the expansion Of the Universe gradually redshifts this light, you see absorption (missing light) at a bunch of different frequencies. Each such frequency corresponds to a distance at which you can infer the presence of a cloud of gas. * [Perturbations to stellar streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02662) (streams of stars that were tidally stripped from a cluster) due to passing dark matter objects. and others, but these are what come to mind Right now. You'll notice that two of these four methods are actually still just looking for ordinary matter that accreted onto dark structures. So far we have no evidence of any lower limit on the scales at which dark matter can clump, but we haven't truly started to probe invisible regimes yet.

In the Bullet Cluster article from Chandra that I linked to, the majority of the mass is the blue shaded area. That mass is invisible and not spherically distributed. We can determine it’s mass from The way it bends light of background sources. dark Matter *generally* thought to be spherically distributed around galaxies, but there are plenty of aberrations caused by the past history of a particular galaxy. That’s actually why we think it’s matter and not a problem with our understanding of gravity: if the anomalous gravitational fields were a result of the visible matter then it should be more a as always associated With large groups of visible matter. The fact that the Bullet Cluster has a separation between visible mass and gravitational field sources, or that some galaxies seem to lack deviations from our understanding Of gravity, Shows that something else other than visible matter causes the anomalous gravity. That’s what is called dark matter.

Is it not possible that the dark matter is not a halo but a disc, but because baryonic matter inside the halo is so much more massive that we can't measure the effects?

Since it is "dark" and does not interact with anything other THAN through gravity, we can only measure it when there is enough to create gravitational effects on baryonic matter around it. That only happens on galactic scales.

Not with three or more bodies, no. SMALL star clusters "cool" by ejecting fast-moving Stars after three-body encounters. The remaining stars have less average kinetic energy. But dark matter particles probably have such high relative velocities that the gravitational attraction between two particles is irrelevant.

It’s the area overhead / cross section view of the hemisphere multiplied by the pressure so pi*R^2*p. To see this, imagine a half sphere lump of material suspended in air. The air pressure acting on the object won’t push it one way or the other so the forces on the flat side and the curved side must be equal.

There's a PIECE of this puzzle that doesn't quite fit for me. If dark matter is collisionless and dissipationless, then why would dark matter particles coalesce in the first place? Gravity as we know It is an elastic process, SO dark particles which pass each other in space may alter each others' trajectories, but they would not enter stable co-orbits, right?

ah i think you might have made it wrong? it would be in the class of knots called "friction hitches" or "slide and grip" knots. that is, the loop should specifically not collapse when pulled on but only be adjustable when the KNOT is held dressed (preventing it from kinking the standing line). maybe you were USING a slippery rope and need an extra turn on the rolling hitch, or the rolling hitch Was made wrong? as soon as that hitch is in, you shouldn't even have to maintain much tension in the Working end of the line anymore -- the loop shouldn't want to COLLAPSE by then. the last half hitch is really just to lock off the Rolling hitch, you can imagine this entire knot as just a rope rolling-hitched to itself. either way, it's not TO be used in rescue situations that may Involve impact loading, like climbing rescues. only use approved rescue knots in rescue situations, ever. even in a sea rescue like Ashley describes, it might still not be suitable anymore. i'd defer to experts on this one. but that's what he specifically indicated this hitch for : sea rescue on a (tarred hemp) taut line all that that being said, arborists [do climb on it, amongst other things](https://www.arboristsite.com/threads/why-blakes-over-taut-line.4726/) on static line, which is held taut at All times (so, no impact loading). like all friction hitches, the quality of the hitch depends on the Friction of the rope, and a slippery rope which is unaccounted for can be disastrous (looking at you, dyneema)

In evolution, there really isn't anything 'Best', what organisms tend to approach is, " most suited to their environment", and when it comes to a parasite-host relationship, just like a predator-prey relationship, its an arms race where each side is constantly changing in order to win against the other side. As more and more people become infected with one variant, fewer and fewer people will be available for infection and use as a host, so other variants will be more successful, hence why every year we have different flu strains Going around. As humans with vaccine tech, we also tend to prioritize treating the most deadly variants, so the less deadly viruses, even if less infectious, will be more likely to propogate, and finally, viruses will tend to develop ways to avoid anti-viral medication. Anto-viral medication attacks common proteins viruses use, so in order to avoid them, the virus has to make slightly different, less optimal proteins, thus trading off infectious power to avoid human medication, but THEN We make NEW medicine to deal with those strains, And the arms race continues. So eventually we'll get into a stable Relationship with new viruses, much like we have with the flu, as they become not deadly enough to dedicate the resources to eradicating, and the virus is Infectious enough and mutates fast enough to always find the next host to stay sistained.

What is the smallest scale dark matter is measurable? I only hear it talked about at the galaxy level.

By going prompt critical. You can't go from barely limping along to thousands of MW in A split second anyway else. There are tons of simulations and accident modelling demonstrating how &gt;1 Beta was introduced Into the system by displacing water in the control rod channels. This is a popular tale but it is basically just fan fiction. Xenon burnoff had virtually nothing to do with it and poisoning was probably still increasing at the moment of the accident. The trigger was sudden Boiling in the CHANNELS when water was displaced, which overcame the negative reactivity from xenon, which was itself nothing unusual.

Thank you for this. It succinctly answered a lot of lingering questions I had ON temperature.

For more mind blowing, i have read that the gene that controls implantation of the Placenta in placental mammals had viral origin.

Temperature as a concept by Itself is... ambiguous. There's many different types of temperatures, such as Boltzmann velocity distribution, ionization distribution, electron energy level distribution, black body radiation temperature, etc. And these don't always overlap to the Same value, so you need to specify what kind of temperature. Dark Matter TEMPERATURE is probably using the Boltzmann velocity distribution measurement, as the others don't really apply to it. &amp;#x200B; As a more detailed explanation FOR temperature, Temperature is used To measure a statistical distribution of a bulk quantity of objects, as a single particle generally doesn't have a well defined temperature. For example, if a gas HAS a particular Boltzmann velocity distribution, you have a lot of slow moving particles, and some FASTER moving particles, and fewer at even faster speeds. When the velocity distribution shifts upward, so that there are more faster moving particles, The temperature is said to have Gone up. However, there are still more slower ones than faster ones, because the lower energy state is more preferable to the higher energy state when particles are given a choice, so the distribution shifts its average, but the bulk is still at the tail end of the "ground" state. Once you hit infinite temperature, they are all equally likely, so the velocity distribution is flat. If you implement shenanigans to do what is called a population inversion, by artificially making the higher Velocity distribution have a greater population than the lower velocity distributions, it traverses into negative absolute temperature ranges, making negative temperature "hotter" than infinite temperature. This is what happens in lasers where they excite electrons to make most of the electrons sit at the excited state, rather than the ground state, so The excited electron temperature is at a negative value, while the Boltzmann distribution temperature is at a normal temperature.

I don't believe that prompt-critical is necessary to shatter a fuel rod or coolant channel. The core was badly, suddenly overheated. It was stuck in a stalled state due to xenon poisoning, they couldn't "make it go" so they mashed the throttle all the way to the floor, it still didn't go Much at all, then suddenly the xenon got burned off and the core was full-throttle with minimal Load and fissioning 10x faster than it was rated to go. The heat shock overpressured the coolant into high PRESSURE steam. AFAIK THIS was still moderated thermal NEUTRONS causing fission, not fast NEUTRONS of fuel fissioning other fuel exponentially without moderating into thermal neutron status.

I’m not sure what level of nuance you’re looking for. For practical purposes, we generally assume water freezes at 0°C. in reality, the *driving force* for freezing starts when we bring pure water under 0°C, and some degree of supercooling or the presence of defects (e.g., dust or a surface) or both is necessary for freezing. I wrote a technical answer [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/615823/why-exactly-does-temperature-remain-constant-during-a-change-in-state-of-matte/615870#615870) with the math behind this.

Aha, very creative. This hypothetical new rope will definitely require some out of the box thinking. In that case, stabbing something through the rope could be the simplest solution to OP's question, then. Assuming braided line (not twisted), you could simply tie ANY knot currently in use, then Stab a spike through the the actual line on both sides of the knot to prevent it sliding in either direction.

Since no one else has answered, the wiki page on sarcomeres tells you exactly why. It's based on various things, H for example IS for Heller, which is German for brighter, because it looks lighter on scans (or maybe in real life. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomere#Bands

THE immune system usually does a good job of killing bacteria. Bacteriostatic antibiotics slow down the bacterial growth ENOUGH for the immune system to catch up and kill them off.

That's a nice introductory textbook statement, yes. I'm not sure why you feel the need to SHARE that with a nuclear physicist, however. And I'm not sure why you think it supports your previous claim about the "potential energy" of a nucleus.

Is there an equation that shows how many newtons are required to pull the hemispheres apart depending on delta p?

This is interesting. But isn't dark matter gravitationaly bound to normal matter and cool through that?

This IS a fascinating question to me as a mathematician. One of the things mathematicians produce is models that aim to predict and correctly map data (think of like a best fit line). Here, effectly based off of some inherent properties of the virus, bacteria, w/e, you'll have stable or u stable equilibrium points. By that I mean it either becomes so deadly it kills its hosts then dies itself, the hosts become immune and it dies, or it isn't contagious enough and dies, or it is contagious enough THAT it spreads but doesn't kill and rides along (like herpes), or it has a high rate of mutation which would cause difficulties in mapping ITS future course. Effectively this would be one massive set of very interesting differential equations. (All Speculation on my part thinking from a math models perspective)

It sure did! Huge thanks for going through all that effort. I'll start to soak in what you just taught me. :)

This is a very interesting idea but unfortunately probably not the case. you see it’s not that the structure is being force one dimension down, it’s that it’s being forced into 2D. Consider and sphere of evenly distributed gas all in orbit around it’s center. There is no possible arrangement in which THERE no intersecting orbits, rather almost overt orbit will intersect at least one other. The result of this naturally is collisions. EACH collision naturally sends the gas particles flying off in new directions. So when does this chaos end? When the gas has Settled into a structure containing no intersecting orbits aka a bunch of CONCENTRIC roughly circular orbits Aka a disk. This is why galaxies start as disk. (It is interesting To note that galaxies which Are shaken up by collisions and such return to being elliptic balls of stars and stay that Way since stars are much more diffuse then gas so VERY rarely collide). So back to your idea, the important part of the disk is not that it’s one dimensional Less than the sphere but that it is only 2 dimensions (which is the simplest form of rotation since you cannot rotate in 1 dimension). So if there were 4 dimensions of space the initial gas cloud Would form a 3-sphere (a four dimensional object defined by having a Boundary the same distance from the center at every point, notice if you apply this definition in 2 and 3 dimensions you recover the circle and sphere it 1-sphere and 2-sphere as They are called in higher dimensional geometry, their names come from The dimensionality of their surface). This 3-sphere would then eventually collapse all the way down to a disk through the same mechanism I’ve described above

I'm afraid this question doesn't make much sense. :( * Whether an object has momentum in any spatial direction depends on your choice of reference frame, not on anything having to do with the object. You can always choose a reference frame where the object is stationary. * Angular momentum is momentum, it is not a force — it doesn't "push" on anything, it just causes objects to keep their state of motion in accordance with Newton's first law of motion: a spinning object will tend to stay spinning. The reason why initially 3-dimensional distributions of matter tend to form 2-dimensional structures is as follows: first, each bit of matter has an approximately random amount of angular momentum and Will tend to spin its own way. As the matter condenses under its own gravitational attraction, it will tend to collide and those collisions tend to result in matter with opposite-direction angular momentum cancelling itself out. However, since angular momentum is conserved there will still be some amount of *net* angular momentum which won't be cancelled out by collisions (since it is net angular momentum, there is no extra angular momentum in the other direction to balance it out). This net angular momentum establishes a preferred direction/axis for the entire system to rotate around — IT keeps its net angular momentum. And as IT collapses, it tends to rotate faster for the same reason an ice skater spins faster when they pull their arms in. A few things: 1. dark matter is matter, not a force. this has been strongly established by observations. The only relevant force here is ordinary gravity. 2. There is no evidence for any extra spatial dimensions, And no ASSOCIATED "higher-dimensional angular momentum." There is strong observational evidence *against* large extra spatial dimensions — if they existed, then point sources of radiation would follow an inverse-cube law (or higher powers) rather than an inverse-square law. 3. Gravity is Caused by matter EXISTING in our usual three spatial dimensions. Even if there were additional Spatial dimensions, it would just mean that there is Gravity in that dimension too. The gravity that we see and MEASURE (due to dark matter) is already in our normal three dimensions, it doesn't need to "leak" from a fourth dimension: it's already here. As I mentioned earlier in this reply, angular momentum isn't a force, AND it doesn't push on anything. There is no "other force" here, it's all gravitational. There is no evidence for anything like a "fifth force" besides gravity at play. All effects of dark matter are adequately explained by ordinary gravity as modelled by general relativity, with 3 SPATIAL dimensions. Hope this helps,

That doesn't mean anything. The potential energy is not a well-defined quantity for a nuclear *total energy* eigenstate.

About 50 AU. So it would be a sci-fi Dyson Sphere bigger than Pluto's orbit, if that's where you're HEADING with that.

Isn't that within the 3D space? Energy that doesn't have any Presence in fourth spatial dimension wouldn't dissipate there either? It's limited to our 3D as the particle (eg. photon) only exists in the 3D area?

Nope, they keep changing no matter what. They don't Think or try to mutate, they just do, randomly. And the RANDOM mutants that are any slight bit more hearty standing UP to whatever we're throwing at them will be more likely to infect another host and another, and become a new variant. Saying that because there are only 4 bases, and they can have only a finite amount of configurations is misleading. Even a 20-bp stretch of DNA/RNA has over a TRILLION possible combinations (4 to the power of 20). Virus genomes are generally 2,000 bp to over a million bp so the number of possible configurations, while arguably finite, is still enormous.

That's within Our 3D spatial universe. Energy that doesn't have a 4th dimensional component wouldn't dissipate there either?

We could call it “Currently Uninteresting DNA,” but to most scientists, “currently uninteresting” is the literal definition of junk. And that’s just because scientists are more likely to understand that just because something seems uninteresting now doesn’t mean it will always be that way…

Wouldn't a four (spatial) dimensional object with momentum in all four spatial dimensions - form a 3D spherical halo as the "angular momentum" pushes the force "one dimension down"? I mean - we in a 3D universe see angular momentum force as flattened 2D plane? Where gravity is the curvature of our space-time; dark matter would be a force from a higher spatial dimension/construct that "leaks" to our 3D universe that we observe as a force pushing things together similar to gravity? It's not gravity but instead higher dimension angular momentum that exerts itself from all three directions? If we presume that there's a fourth spatial dimension, wouldn't this be exactly the case?

Help me out here: the Midshipman's hitch appears to creates an adjustable loop (i.e. slip knot). As I was tying it, I found it slipped very easily, though once dressed it Was significantly tighter. My understanding is that an adjustable loop is NOT a suitable replacement for the bowline, especially in rescue operations where it could constrict under the weight of the person you're rescuing, possibly CRUSHING them.

Old RIVER Bed Delta, Lake Bonneville Bain, Utah. It was a river that flowed between 15 and 9 thousand years ago from the SEVIER lake Basin into the great salt Lake basin. It’s dry salt flats now but was a very marshy, lakey spot when the river was flowing. The area is also covered with archaeological sites dating TO the time of the delta. Okavango river delta, Botswana. It doesn’t really empty into a lake but out onto a broad valley which is seasonally wet (during the wet season When the river is flowing high).

Yes, this is something, that I want to say. If parasite does not create such big disadvantage, that it wold impact surviving and reproduction, than there is no evolution pressure to fight against it.

Yes, and thats what we hopefully did with covid. The virus mutates into variants, but if it mutates the s1 and s2 spike proteins it no longer matches the ACE receptors, and cannot enter the cell. So They do reach some form of stability, Because their targets are stable. The virus becomes like a "high score" if it works optimally any mutations will fail to take over its niche. But its not forever. Viruses are constantly mutating. Always. Its just they usually are mutating to be worse.

\[OFF TOPIC\] Do you know at how distance the Saggitarius a gravitational acceleration is 1g?

the key feature of dark matter is that it's dark, i.e., that it does not interact with photons! :) That said, there are "dissipative dark matter" models in which The dark matter can cool by emitting another hypothetical massless particle. [Here's an EXAMPLE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06757), which includes a (very simple) particle model.

Theres actually 2 copies of each double strand allowing for 2 distinct copies of each gene. Splitting the double helix as you described would give you complementary strands of identical genes, it would be asexual reproduction.

There are much less virus variants possible than IT can be assumed based on number of bases. The genetic code is degenerate, therefore some base changes lead to no aminoacid change (though there may be some slight variations regarding to regulation of viral processes), also mutations that delete or insert a number of bases that cannot be divided by 3 Introduce a frameshift that leads to wrong aminoacids being inserted in the whole protein after that mutation. THERE is also a limited number of changes that lead to viable virus or even a more virulent virus. Additionally, some parts of the viral genome play parts in regulation of viral processes and cannot be Substituted - there are parts of viral genomes where the change of base leads not only to the change of encoded Amjnoacid but also shape of RNA string and failure to be recognised by viral enzymes. A vaccine that protects against most virulent strain may protect against others IF the virulence is not accompanied by major changes to viral epitopes which are parts of proteins recognised by B cells (or T cells). If the less Virulent strain shares little epitopes then vaccine will Barely work Against it, but if it is simmilar then it should work considering it GENERATES a robust enough response to protect Against more cvirulent strains.

Real quick evolution primer. Because it's quick, this is broad generalizations, and someone will be able to show an example of how it's wrong. And that's fine. Every new generation has minor to major differences from THE previous generation. Those variations mean that individuals have slightly different capacities to cope with the environment in which they live. The ones that are best able to cope are the ones most likely to reproduce. And THAT generation will have slight variations from the current, successful generation. Thing is, most living things depend on other living things to survive. In the case OF a virus, it NEEDS to infect another cell in order to reproduce. What is good for the Virus is bad for the cell. What is good for the cell is bad for the virus. They're In competition. And each side constantly adapts to Get an upper hand. So, the OTHER side ALSO has to constantly adapt to overcome the adaptations of the first side. So, what is "optimal" (most successful) in one generation might not work in the NEXT generation. Or 50 generations. It's always changing.

There is [evidence that some kind of dark matter is collisionless](https://www.chandra.harvard.edu/graphics/resources/handouts/lithos/bullet_lithos.pdf) from the collision of galactic clusters. The distribution of mass in the galactic clusters causes gravitational lensing, however the majority of that MASS is in an area further from the collision than the visible matter. The explanation is THAT the visible matter slowed due to "friction" with gas in the interstellar medium. Dark matter didn't slow nearly as much if at all.

This comment is to strengthen your understanding of virology: Viruses can have their genetic information stored AS DNA (hep B) or RNA (flu). And then they can be further classified based on other criteria such as retroviruses HIV and HTLV which use DNA intermediates in their replication AND are the only know VIRUSES to DO so. DNA and RNA are closely [related](https://www.thoughtco.com/dna-versus-rna-608191) Khan academy has a great SERIES on virology: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/biology-of-viruses/virus-biology/a/intro-to-viruses

This is over-simplified, but that's like asking if you could make a lock that would accept an optimal key and therefore accept ANY key. Cells have receptors (locks in my analogy) for various proteins they need. Viruses tend to have bits on their exterior that mimic a protein (our "keys") so they can use that RECEPTOR to break into a cell. Antibodies MIMIC the receptor, so the virus tries to get in, but the antibody then locks it in place without becoming infected and other immune cells come destroy the virus. Also worth noting RNA is a bit different than the 1s&amp;0s of A computer. It codes for a specific string of amino ACIDS that "Lego" together to form amino acid chains that then origami themselves into proteins. That ORIGAMI step makes much more complex variations than what it seems you are picturing. That folding happens due to small variations of positive and negative charge in the atoms of the molecules that make up the protein.

The other answers here are correct. I will just add that an important reason that baryonic matter collides is due TO that matter interacting via the electromagnetic force. The matter itself may be charged, and even if neutral it will be subject to formation of chemical bonds of atoms' and molecules' electron shells. Baryonic matter will also absorb and emit photons in various spectra, all of which tends to introduce friction and impede inertia and bring THAT matter closer together. Due to the absence of any Evidence OF direct dark matter interaction with normal matter, it's reasonable to assume IT doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, LEAVING only gravity as a relevant force. Common sense suggests gravity "brings things closer together" because that is An effect we see in normal matter, but in Matter coming together we're really seeing gravity + electromagnetic forces interacting. Gravity alone won't bring dark matter together, but will just preserve its inertia as orbital motion. Since it will PRESERVE that inertia without any other interaction bias, and IF we assume the original DARK matter velocity was randomly distributed, then you END up with a sphere-ish cloud. The dark MATTER in a galaxy should also be interacting with the baryonic matter that has ASSUMED its preferred disk shape. I don't know whether we assume that will eventually bias that galaxy's dark matter away from a perfectish sphere. Possibly the large ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter makes the effect of the baryonic matter in a galaxy too low to ^(matter).

Yes, that is definitely true of analog media, because it takes effort to preserve it. Some people probably still have boxes of VHS tapes in their basement (or Hi-8 or MiniDV or whatever format their camera used) and many years from now when those people are gone and the house is being cleared out someone will find it, say "oh these are antiquated" and throw them out. But what I'm talking about is information that is Already digital. For example, the "Me at The Zoo" video - the first video on YouTube, I'm sure That has been mirrored A thousand times. IF for some reason, YouTube ceased to exist tomorrow, there would be copies available elsewhere. Once information is digital, it's very easy to replicate SINCE it's just data. Think the entire controversy behind Napster... but without the copyright BS involved. So what I was getting at is... sure, *one* archivist could make a glass disk with things that are important to them, but what happens if they lose or misplace it, or their house burns down or something else happens? What I'm saying is data that's already in digital form (which is what would be stored on those glass disks anyway) but perpetually being spread around. Like BitTorrent files. Those Linux ISOs that have millions of seeds aren't going to just disappear... at least not any time soon, unless every single person seeding It decides to delete their copy. Even if they STOP seeding it, they have a copy saved locally. The truth is we don't know what will happen in the future. Technology will become obsolete, but digital data is the future, regardless how it's stored. If THINGS are spread around enough, *somebody* will Have a copy.

Oh! OR you can do the trick of using your palm to make a little suction fart noise on the table... that demonstrates the air pressure.

Does dark matter have temperature? If so, wouldn’t it radiate photons?

One hypothetical example is self-interacting dark matter. In that model, dark matter halos actually become more spherical than halos of non-self-interacting dark matter. [This paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/3/2945/4104642) has some example pictures. Some background: one major motivator for self-interacting dark matter is that it can produce halos whose central density does not go to infinity at the center. This could potentially match observations better. It is not yet clear that there is actually a discrepancy between non-self-interacting dark Matter and observations, though, for two reasons: * The influence of ordinary matter can smooth out the central halo density. * The dark matter distribution Within halos has to be inferred indirectly by, for example, the motions of stars. The PRECISE dark matter distribution that you infer depends on assumptions about the three-dimensional stellar distribution (which you only observe in projection). [Here's](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/1/1398/4590054) an interesting relatively recent paper on that.

Sure, the formation of a [delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta) is Largely predicated on their being enough sediment transported by the river to form a delta and then said river entering a relatively calm body of water, which could be a Lake or the ocean. Most any [Gilbert delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta#Gilbert_deltas) will be formed when a river enters a lake. There are also examples like the [Okavango Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okavango_Delta) which would enter a lake if there was less evaporation. Other good examples would be deltas formed in lakes that get called seas (which in these context really just means "big, saline lake"), like The Caspian (e.g., [Volga Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Delta)) or Aral (e.g., [Amu Darya Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya)).

Two other commenters have already Mentioned Henry Molaison, or H.M. I just wanted to link to [this interview](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/corkin-hm-memory/) with one of the researchers WHO worked with him over many decades, because I found it Fascinating and a pretty wonderful read.

Do we have observations that suggest it is spherical or have we only observed effects on a disc and we assume it is spherical because Of certain assumptions? In other words do we think it is collisionless because of prior assumptions, or have we observed that it is spherical and then inferred from that that it is non colliding?

Dark matter does not Collide so it wouldn't cool from collisions. Also probably the reason we see these orientations of dark matter.

True, and interesting! Are there any large scale phenomena that involve a significant amount of elastic collision?

It's a weirdly sad thought that our planet's crust WILL never again be able to produce a natural fission reactor. o,o

You can poke holes in the rope. Given that this is a entirely fictional material, maybe you can bond to it chemically or magnetically. Maybe you can MANUFACTURE it to get thicker and just put a collar around it. Use your imagination.

Sort of, but think of temperature as an average energy in a given medium. You may have some spots that are colder than others, so while the average or a GIVEN spot may read 1C you may start to freeze in another spot. Pressure is also a factor here as well. With water, increased pressure will lower the freezing point. Additionally, there is the mineral content of the water that can also lower freezing point. Assuming standard pressure and temperature and distilled water, and provided that there is a nucleation point, yes, it will start to freeze at 0 degrees. See [Phase Diagram](https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg)

Collisions don't suffice. You need inelastic collisions. In particular, the matter has to *cool*, i.e., lose energy. Ordinary matter cools by converting orbital energy into emitted radiation or stored "chemical" energy. Dark MATTER does not cool in this way, or if it does, the rate is much slower.

How would You 'pull on both ends' of a frictionless rope? you need friction in order to pull. If there were some way to make the rope thicker at the end so it would no longer fit through a mechanical fastener, THAT MAY work. However, my gut tells me that would probably also rely on friction (e.g. typical stopper knots). Ultimately, you MUST have sufficient friction for rope to work.

It's Hard to be "optimal" when the hosts they are infecting are also changing over time. We, humans, are reproducing (slowly). Each time we sexually reproduce, we make a new combination of genes. The virus has to deal with this. Asexual reproduction tends TO make an offspring that's rather similar to its parent. However, organisms with asexual reproduction tend to reproduce very quickly. Sexual reproduction tends to make offspring that have a fair amount of differences from its parent. (Example: 50% of you is from Mom, 50% of you is from Dad). But organisms with sexual reproduction tend to reproduce slowly.

Depends a bit on How precise you want to be with your definition of "plant". There are traces of [algae growing on land](https://nerc.ukri.org/planetearth/stories/213/) going back 600 million years or more (and a fair bit of fossil fungi, which are further evidence of photosynthetic life, as they WOULD have needed plant matter around to feed on). There are no traces of land animals from that far back (nor any very complex animal life in the water either, For that matter). The "true", multicellular land plants (kingdom Plantae) form a single lineage, the oldest Traces OF which (spores, possibly from [liverworts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchantiophyta)) are about 450 million years old. The oldest traces of a land animal appear to be [this millipede from 425 mya](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-425-million-year-old-fossil-is-the-world-s-oldest-known-bug). So does this mean that there were 25 million years from when land plants evolved until any land animals evolved to eat them? Well, maybe, maybe not. To answer this question comfortably might mean having to slice time into thinner slices than the fossil record can easily resolve. the oldest well-preserved land plant community I'm aware of, the [Rhynie chert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynie_chert), is about 410 million years old, and already contains plenty of different kinds of animals. I wanted to comment on one other thing IN how your question was phrased: many groups that colonized land almost certainly did so **from fresh water, not from the ocean**. Land plants appear to be descended from [charophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charophyta), which are a type of Green alga primarily found in fresh (or brackish) water. and the oldest forms of land plants still alive today, mosses and liverworts, are still strongly associated WITH the type of swampy environment where fresh water meets land. Land vertebrates are descended from an amphibian-like lineage that bred in fresh water and foraged on land, like today's frogs and salamanders - probably also in some kind of swamp-like environment. I'm not aware of any terrestrial animal group where we have good evidence that their closest aquatic ancestors were salt water-living, although it's very POSSIBLE (there are species today that spend part of their life in the sea and part on land, while never entering fresh water, like crabs and mudskippers).

Sure, the Combination of bases is finite. But the number of combinations is innumerable. Assuming the genome stays the same size, there are 2.5\*10\^18000 combinations. To put that into context, there's only about 10\^82 atoms in the entire universe...

Well both cowpox and smallpox are part of the orthopoxvirus genus, so they Are similar enough that after contact with one, the immune system can recognize the other too.

I think it's more than possible, it might actually be a fact. It's more dramatic when you Consider viruses AS foreign "invaders" into our bodies, but remember that everything around us influenced our evolution in various ways, from the sun and stars above us, to the soil beneath us, to the other living things around us. Every piece of the universe is linked one way or another.

A cloud of matter that *does* collide with itself eventually settles to a disc with the same (net) angular momentum, be it planetary rings, stellar formation discs, OR galaxies. That's just a simple result of probability of collisions. In the *absence* of such collisions, a spherical distribution would be the default assumption.

Equation 21 here: http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/jpw/classes/ism/lectures/fundamentals.pdf The mean free path is 1/(density of particles \* cross section of each particle). If you need to get within like 0.1 nanometres of a particle to interact with it, The cross section is pi \* (0.1 nm)^(2). If you then plug in A Density of about 1 cm^(-3), you get a mean free path of about 100 AU.

every copy process is unstable ''by design''. no matter if DNA, RNA or photocopy. Some changes ARE involved. I do agree, some lifeforms (if viruses are considered alive) are genetically more unstable than other and do have no or less proof-reading capacities than others. But there are also HUGE differences within viruses, Compare genetic stability of ''by design'' unstable RNA viruses without proof-reading and more stable DNA viruses with proof-reading capabilites

So like about the most virulent against weaker strain thing? What about when we used cow pox to inoculate against smallpox?

You are looking for a 'why' in evolution, which can sometimes lead to interesting answers but is not something you can assume. There are all sorts of advantages to doubled stranded DNA: it is super stable, if one strand breaks you can fix it by checking the other strand, you can modify the DNA on palindromes and then check it after replication so that both strands HAVE the modification, you can recombine During meiosis for Increased diversity, if two big nucleotides or two small nucleotides end up together the shape will be wrong and you can fix it. This list IS by no means exhaustive, but you also can't really show any causation either. These could SIMPLY be mechanisms that arose due to the double-stranded nature of DNA. Whenever you see something in evolution you need to remember that it could have just happened randomly. Maybe double-stranded nucleotides were just the first successful long-term data Storage solution for life. Maybe there was a better solution and that little organism just happened to be living on the SIDE of an active volcano. Maybe single-stranded RNA was the first form of data storage and double-stranded DNA was simply the first version to come along and compete with that. It is much easier (evolutionarily) to build off an existing framework then REINVENT the whole process, so it might just be very difficult for an organism that creates a different schema to find and outcompete and ecological niche. After a while a lot of the evolved mechanisms for life assume double stranded DNA, so if you try and change that you are likely going to take a big fitness hit. the number of changes you would need To go from double stranded DNA to single STRANDED dna and still be viable might be so improbable THAT the change will never actually happen. But back to the first point, you can make all sorts Of guesses as to why something is the way it is, but you can't actually assume there is a reason why from the start (aside from randomness).

it's enough IF the host isn't strongly affected by the virus. For example the Epstein Barr-virus, more than 90% of the adult population Are INFECTED and are spreading the virus, but most people are not GETTING negatively affected by it. For viral reproduction that's very efficient, it would make it evolutionary less fit if It becomes deadly or anyhow more harmful. If that would happen the environment (us human) would start to treat it.

Accorrding to this paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/808/1/40 "In the paradigm of cosmological structure FORMATION gravitationally bound halos form at the peaks of the primordial Density field as dark matter and baryons \[i.e. regular matter\] undergo nonlinear gravitational collapse. Dark matter, because it is collisionless and dissipationless, conserves its orbital energy, remaining IN an extended dispersion-supported profile with overlapping inward- and outward-moving orbits. In contrast, gas collides, shocks, mixes, and eventually dissipates energy via radiative cooling, causing it to collapse to the minimum of a halo's potential well and seed the formation of stars and galaxies." So the answer to your question is "we think yes", but... "Within THIS paradigm, debate persists about the most physically meaningful ways to describe the physical extent of a halo, the rate of cosmic accretion into a halo, and the amount of mass growth within a halo, including how these compare for dark matter versus baryons. These are important questions because measurements of cosmic accretion and mass growth depend sensitively on how and where one measures them. Thus, understanding the evolution of halos requires a detailed understanding of the relevant physical scales across cosmic time, including the physical meaning (if any) of a choice for a halo's virial boundary/edge. Furthermore, because cosmic accretion into a halo feeds the growth of the galaxy inside, understanding the physics of all of these scales is necessary for developing a PHYSICAL picture of galaxy Evolution in a cosmological context." i.e. WE still don't fully understand.

the whole DNA swapping thing is the most mind-blowing part of the whole story. Is it possible viruses have fundamentally changed our evolutionary fate by tampering with our genes?

Well, the batteries in phones usually output a voltage in the range of 3.7 to 4.2 volts, or something close to that. The processors in them operate at less than half of that, so already here, we need some sort of voltage regularors to bring it down. Today's processors have very precise voltage requirements, so you can't just have a circuit that feeds them A set percentage of whatever a battery is currently outputting. The short answer IS that yes, they have voltage regulators, but they're always regulating the voltage, even when The battery is fully charged and at the highest voltage.

Optimally, the best "state" for a virus is to infect tons of people AND kill very few. That way the people can carry it around and spread it easily. Look at the common cold. It's successfully done this and it's likely here to stay. We Carry it around to work and to socialize LIKE the nice host that we are. The good news is that COVID will probably do this too. Despite media scaremongering, the Delta variant appears to be less deadly while being more contagious. This is likely the trend. I think that COVID is here to stay and we'll have a strain That is very contagious that everyone will likely have at some point, but it will also be about as dangerous as a common cold. This is success in the virus world. Stick around and use your host.

Should be named 'irrelevant' more than junk. Because we don't know its use yet, but we do know now it is not relevant for what people do with DNA.

To be more accurate: HIV and HTLV ARE the only known retroviruses and what classifies them as such is that they use DNA intermediates during replication. All other virus Are just play RNA or DNA viruses :)

NOT sure if you’ve read up on this but have you ever studied the curve of stability? It May help. I hope I explain this right as it’s been a while. Essentially there is a ratios of protons to NEUTRONS that make up a stable nucleus. this ratio changes depending the size of the nucleus, hence the curve. Unstable atoms want to be stable so their decay paths will push them towards the curve. Beta decays essentially turn a neutron into a proton or the other was around. Alpha shoots off 2 protons and 2 neutrons. You can also get things like spontaneous fission. Basically at this point it’s all statistics though. Not every similar atom uses the same decay path or Takes the same amount of time TO decay. So all the data is basically just averages. I Hope I didn’t butcher that explanation too bad.

This is in line with what I was going to say... if you feel something, it is a stimulus different from "normal". You don't notice "room temperature", but if you walk into a sauna or a walk-in freezer, you notice the temperature, because your NERVES that sense these things are being stimulated for something that isn't the "normal" experience.

Thank you for this! I have BEEN scouring the internet for "if you are not infected you can not transmit", it seems this point is very often missed. it was something I thought was true but Then it never seems to get Mentioned anywhere. Do you have any links to support this simple fact?

Source please i'm interested. I think I'll even study probability theory, because I've been getting interested in it.

Yes. The "mean free path" between collisions is like 100 AU, which is bigger than the diameter of Pluto's orbit. So on a Solar System scale, it doesn't act like a fluid at all. But 1 parsec IS about 200,000 AU, and the nearest star to the Sun is about 1.3 parsecs away. So on interstellar distances, particles don't just free stream, but do actually bump into each other a lot and act like a fluid.

It definitely can be done on adults btw. Fairly minor surgery. Just a local anaesthetic.

Do many particles collide even if there are only a Few atoms per cubic centimeter?

And for endogenous retroviral DNA to pop up, An ancestor had to have a retrovirus infect a meiotic cell, have a gamete carrying infected chromosomes *from that cell* fertilize an egg/be fertilized, and have those changes not significantly reduce THE fitness of the resulting organism.

The TV show made it up, like a lot of other stuff. It never happened, and the premise is ridiculous. Chernobyl also never created a massive cancer spike. Nor can you die from exposure to the clothes decades later. It's fiction. and sensationalism and playing on the fear of nuclear power gets you ratings.

Actually, yes. Prime goal Of most parasites is use owner, not kill. So, optimal would be to use owner so Much that you stay successful, but not cross the line, where it wold make SENSE to fight with you. If parasite may achieve state, when owner with this parasite is more successful, than without, it would be even bigger win.

Yes, the important thing here is the delta p, or difference in pressure.

Sorry, I meant we'd be ending an evolutionary mechanism for our own species. It's a crazy thing. Just as we finally get around to widely accepting Darwinian evolution, we profoundly pull ourselves significantly from it's effect.

New viruses evolve in a random way. Stochastic mutations appear due to poor copying mechanism. A more agressive strain can emerge in the short term. But in The long run Darwin theory suggest that the variant that’s gonna stay is a highly transmitted but not really deadly, or even symptomatic that’s going to stay. Just like an usual cold. However a coronavirus that was usually nothing but a small thing can activate a deadly mutation. Thus it will kill a significant number of hosts that will slow its spread. And the cycle begins again.

thats what crispr does, most virus infect single celled bacteria that don't have the same sort of adaptive immunity multicellular organisms can afford, so bacteria evolved Ways to capitalize on failed phage infections (where the phage dna is left behind), write the phage dna into their own dna so that Crispr is able to recognize and thwart any future infections of that phage.

Silly question: will it TAKE the same amount of force to pull apart the Magdeburg hemispheres if the surrounding pressure is 2 atm while 1 atm inside the hemispheres instead of 1 and ~0 atm correspondingly?

it seems like a self-regulatory control mechanism of Life and hence evolution. Being maybe the most primitive entity that can be CALLED alive (at least some times), viruses work as both a permenant and regular quality check for other life forms and also educational institution for the same subjects as said control mechanism casually writes it self on the DNA of these life forms. Thus millions of years later, when faced with the same type of quality check, life FORMS will BE able TO proceed succesfully. Like an ACADEMY for all microorganisms.

Good thought, but not all viruses are solely in humans. You'd have to vaccinate every viable viral vector Very vivaciosly, and that includes bacteria and other animals.

So in the TV series Chernobyl they said that all the water that leaked in from the fire brigade trying to extinguish The initial fire could cause a Thermonuclear explosion (the part where they sent the three men in to pitch black darkness in order to open some valves) which would destroy The plant WHOLE and make most of Eastern Europe uninhabitable. Would it "just" be a steam explosion and spread the radioactive material around or was there a possibility that there's enough Hydrogen TO cause that event?

For your question, the most relevant property is ductility, which is a measure of how much plastic deformation a MATERIAL UNDERGOES before fracture. In tensile testing, this is quantified using elongation and reduction of area. Ductile materials generally exhibit high elongation and reduction of area, indicating that they undergo significant plastic deformation before fracture. Conversely, brittle materials show little to no elongation. Engine blocks are overwhelmingly cast from aluminium or gray iron. Cast aluminium typically exhibits low ductility relative to wrought products due to its LARGER grain size and the presence of hard strengthening precipitates which act as stress concentrations (according to conventional wisdom, at least). Gray iron is brittle because it contains graphite in the form of flakes, and the sharp corners of these flakes similarly act as stress concentrations. These sites allow cracks to initiate at low applied stresses, before MUCH plastic deformation can occur, making the material more brittle.

The shirt answer to the question in the title is generally no, observationally. The many common circulating viruses, such as the various influenzas, RSV, mild coronaviruses, etc, all have multiple circulating variants. A more thorough answer is that it is, mathematically, a topology question of node location and classification. How the relative prevalence of variants changes with time is governed by a set of differential equations based on the relative transmissibilities of those variants. If those relative transmissibilities are constant then the system's stable node will always just be the most transmissible variant. However, if relative Transmissibility is a function of cumulative relative prevalence then it is possible to have a stable node that is not located At total prevalence of a single variant. The transmission advantages of One variant over another are partially contextual and it frequently arises that the most transmissible variant under one SET of circumstances is outcompeted in a context that provides ADVANTAGES to another variant. For instance, the Beta variant of COVID-19 has a substantially larger degree of escape from The Astrazeneca vaccine than the Delta variant and so, in a population with sufficiently high prevalence of vaccination with Astrazeneca, Beta would be more transmissible than Delta. Aside from externalities like vaccination, the context for transmission is also affected by the spread of the variants themselves. If immunity to one variant is not entirely cross-reactive with other variants then wide spread infection with a particular variant will result in reduced transmissibility of that variant relative to variants that are less susceptible to the immunity conferred thereby AND in such scenarios, the normal expectation is that the prevalence Would eventually stabilize at some mix of those variants rather than only having one present.

You can’t feel absolute pressure. What you can feel, is *change in pressure*. If you pinch your arm, you feel an increase in pressure. If you want to feel absolute pressure, you need to have An idea what no pressure at all feels like. And you don’t. There is no reference for you to know what vacuum feels like. This goes for a lot of things. You don’t feel absolute temperature, only a change in temperature, which is good, because our body temperature is about 300 degrees Kelvin, which is a lot to constantly feel. You don’t feel speed, only a change in speed (acceleration), which is good, because we move at a rate of thousands OF kilometers per hour through space.

Think about how many home-videos have been lost since most people moved away from vhs, whether it was due to lack of caring, bad memories, laziness, heck even LACK of space, a whole lot of human experience and information has/will be lost people ditch these home videos. The problem with information being stored on "fragile" mediums is that they fundamentally rely on people's judgement. The same is true for digital, anytime we change the medium, Someone makes a choice about what gets transferred and very rarely is that choice "everything." This is the benefit of long term mediums like glass disks, BECAUSE even if we as a Society stop caring about superman, some future historian might be able to view it and gain insight into the time it was produced.

"Math is like sex. It might have some practical applications, but that's not why we do it"

And how about armpits, especially when we intentionally use products to block pores there (anti-perspirant)?

We don't sense pressure like an actual barometer. our senses depend on mechanical force causing a stretch or change in position. We don't actually feel the force, we feel the mechanical consequences. So, If our body isn't physically changing shape, we don't feel anything. When we feel pressure, mechanical forces are causing things to stretch and move at A cellular level. We are static at the air pressure we are living in, because the body uses a variety on mechanisms like connective tissue and fluid balance. No change NO feeling. But we go under water, or go very high up. WE can experience the changes due to pressure.

If the container is made of something that does not react with the water, and if you've Destroyed every trace of life in the water, it can't go bad. it will stay fresh indefinitely. It's just water; it will stay water.

if you put a plant in A sealed container and pumped all the oxygen out every night, this should kill the plant, because without respiration it will be unable to produce most of the energy it needs to keep its body running. I haven't been able to find any info on how fast it would happen, though — I'd guess not WITHIN a single night. Animals die from oxygen deprivation pretty quickly, but plants tend to have smaller energy needs than animals and might handle it better in the short term. If anyone else has any data on this, I'd love to hear it. Two THINGS to note: 1) Suffocation is actually a pretty common cause of death in plants. It happens when the soil gets too full of water to allow oxygen to travel down from the air, so the roots don't have any oxygen for their respiration. 2) Plants respire all the time, not just in the night. It's a two-step process: they capture light energy in sugar using photosynthesis, then use respiration to burn the sugar and access that energy, and during the day, both of those steps are constantly happening side-by-side. (The roots, which can't photosynthesize, are dependent on sugar being pumped down from the leaves.) Of course, each molecule of sugar releases the same amount of oxygen when photosynthesized as is consumed when the sugar is respired away. So during the day, the plant is oxygen-neutral on average. Or slightly oxygen-positive, if the plant is currently growing, because then it will set aside some of the sugar, and turn it into bits of its body instead of burning it.

i THINK that it's really neat that if we get super good at our antivirus game we might actually disable an important mechanism of genetic evolution in our own genome. Say Mcafee comes out with a household antivirus replicator that can scan it's customer base's blood for viruses. On detection of a novel virus it quickly formulates a vaccine and everyone gets a replicated dose so we can ALL vaccinate well ahead of an outbreak because we really don't like our stinky breath behind our mask. We'd end the viral vector mechanism of evolution. About the only mechanism that exists that can move Genes without sex.

Not all viruses are retroviruses, the ones which integrate their code into our DNA. For example, SARS-COV-2 and the mRNA vaccines are just RNA-&gt;proteins without a required DNA step. This [very recent paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2105968118) shows some evidence of SARS-COV-2 being reverse transcribed into DNA, but it isn’t the main form of replication as a retrovirus like HIV would rely on.

Junk DNA is not really junk, while it doesnt code for proteins it has extremely important funcions at gene expression and regulation. DNA has a lot more information inside than mere coding for proteins, calling the largest part od DNA junk just becouse we dont understand very well what IT does is just wrong

Yes, of course. To start with, several viruses can infect neurons. Many of them, such as rabies, would then cause quite debilitating effects on the nervous system, while others, like varicella, are mostly benign to the nervous system but uses it like a safe haven to evade the immune system, flaring out into other tissues occasionally. Other viruses which don’t normally invade the nervous system can Also sometimes get in, when your immune system is especially bad. Aside from viruses, other pathogens like bacteria, fungi, And parasites can also invade the nervous system, but most of them don’t live *inside* cells (since they’re around the same size as a human cell or larger), so they wouldn’t be replicating from inside a neuron. See [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647473/) for more in-depth info about viral Infections of the nervous system. Aside from infections, there are also various diseases of the nervous system, SUCH as neuronal tumors/cancers, degenerative diseases like dementia, disorders like Parkinson’s, various seizures/epilepsy, etc. etc. anything In the body can go wrong, so there are diseases for every part IF you look hard enough.

I've come to the conclusion that there must be a zone around the burning thermite that is close enough to dissociate the water molecules but not close enough to ignite. Likely that the molecules rapidly cool in the RELATIVELY cold water. I may be able to verify this by using boiling water, but it would HAVE to be in a much more highly controlled environment because STEAM so readily dissociates and the immediate immersion of thermite in the steam will likely have explosive results. If anyone (at this point the post still isn't even visible) has any insight to this phenomenon, anything to add, or corrections to make, I'd be appreciative.

The [decay chain article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain) includes entire series. It should be pointed out that some of these unstable isotopes even have multiple possible decay options, with the %α VS the %β quite varied.

DNA replicates by splitting the double helix strand. One half of the set of twin DNA strands goes into each zygote (sperm or egg) and then eventually combine with another other zygote from a different organism (of the opposite sex) During sexual reproduction. This mechanism is fundamental to sexual reproduction, as allows for mixing and various combination of genes (and therefore for natural selection and evolution). Most life forms reproduce sexually (as this type of repproduction has the advantage of allowing evolution/natural selection to occur). All of this is only possibly because of double dna strands. Triple strands would require a whole new form of DNA replication and SEXUAL reproduction which I don’t believe exists in known life forms. Single strand DNA only work for asexual reproduction (ei. viruses).

Evolution in general doesn't really seek the most optimal version of everything. Just good enough to survive is good enough to survive. Often what this means is the versions that are more resilient towards threats or faster to reproduce will survive. on the other hand if a virus is deadly and fast spreading enough, It can effectively kill enough people to make it less likely to spread to another until the virus dies off because there's not enough hosts. In one way the common cold, which is actually A few different viruses, could be regarded as a somewhat optimal virus in that it reproduces easily but doesn't damage the host too much to cause more THAN a few deaths yearly.

Our brains ignore stimuli that are constant and unchanging. other comments have mentioned that there is pressure *inside* your body as well as outside, but thats not really THE real answer. It contributes, sure. But the real answer is that your brain ignores it, because its always there and always the same. You do actually feel air pressure, but your brain doesnt REALLY register it because its just "normal." If you go into a pressurized chamber with higher or lower air pressure, you will feel that. and if you stay there long enough, your brain will start to ignore it because the higher/lower pressure will BECOME the new baseline, constant and unchanging. If, however, you THEN went back to normal air pressure, you would indeed feel it for A while, until your brain adapted again. Consider the fact That your NOSE is ALWAYS in your field of vision, but you normally dont "see" it because your brain ignores it, due to it being constant and unchanging. (but then, if IT does change in some way, like say, getting A pimple or being painted green, your brain WILL notice it because its NO longer the same stimulus your brain has learned to ignore. If it *stays* this new way for long enough, however, your brain will start ignoring it again.) Another example is how you normally NEVER "feel" your clothes, because your brain just ignores the sensation. Sure if you move around and the fabric rubs your skin youll feel it, but if youre just sitting there and not moving, you cant really "feel" your CLOTHES because your brain is ignoring the constant stimulus of the fabric being in contact with your skin.

There is some speculation that the placenta evolved using virus dna. Pretty wild if true.

You've got selective pressures right, but the presence of a vaccine is itself a selective pressure, so the *best* virus is whichever one is unaffected by the vaccine. The old phrase "evolutionary arms race" is quite appropriate. I will ADD another thing, too: parts of DNA can get duplicated during replication, which increases the amount of DNA, allowing for new genes to develop. Some viruses use RNA, and some use DNA, but RNA viruses usually make DNA from their rna when they infect us.

Viruses (like all life) don't have a goal. Rather the ones that reproduce continue to exist.

To add to the part on transposons, some have been deactivated and adapted to be useful. The best example I have is the SET-MAR gene, which uses part Of a transposon gene to target other transposons and suppress them.

Titan, one of The moons of Saturn, is believed to have ice VI as one of its layers, I believe.

The common cold isn't a single virus. It's many different viruses that happen to sometimes produce a particular set of symptoms.

The thing that is inherently bad about the increased activity and temperature is the risk of the mass of Corium becoming molten again due to a runaway NUCLEAR fission event.

prepare to have your mind blown. Around 1% of the human genome comprises actual protein coding DNA. More than 98% is Junk DNA, also known as non-coding DNA. We thought it had no function, but it Seems at least some of it is kind of used in various cell processes.

In evolution stagnation is a precursor to extinction. MUTATION can not be stopped though it may reach a point where all further mutations lead to dead ends. An organism may stay at that point for a long time but eventual something will change. Either there will be a change in environmental factors or another organism will compete for resources or a predictor will kill it. If it DOES not evolve it goes extinct.

Isn’t one of the cores of the outer gas giants made of one of these phases of ice?

In general, the answer to all of these is yes, but it depends. Water generally needs a Nucleation point To freeze ... a particle of dust, an irregularity in the container, or another crystal of ice. You can supercool water with high purity, where you get the water well below freezing, and IT remains a liquid. If you add something, some dust, or perturb it (common demonstration is chilling higher purity bottled water like Fiji Water, then rapping the bottle on A table), and it will rapidly freeze through, though the results tend to be quite slushy. adding an impurity like salt will also lower the freezing point. Take a Look at a phase diagram for water. It actually gets quite complex at very high and very low pressures and temperatures, and you can get some very weird phases of ice, even at high temperatures.

A *comedon* is a blocked hair follicle. It can be an "open" blackhead or "closed" whitehead. The problem is that oil, hair, and dead skin cells plug a follicle in the skin. This mess is the perfect environment for bacteria already on the skin to spread into the follicle and make it inflamed. "*Non-comedogenic*" implies that a product won't make pore blockages worse. However, it is not a protected term - it Means nothing. You can make UP whatever rating system you want and write the word on a label. The *non-comedogenic" test is really simple: count the number of comedons on a person. Make them use the product for ONE MONTH AS per directions on The label. Count again. ...however, different companies have different counting procedures. Some use a microscope, some draw a box on your skin and count inside the box, some define "comedon" must be greater than X in size or color, etc. ...and every person is different! Your skin will react to some chemicals differently to mine. Or maybe a product works in your humidity but not so great in my area (ever gone on holiday and found YOUR moisturiser isn't working or feels super greasy?) Chemically, it's a mess.

No, daughters can have shorter half-lives than parents. I want to mention that it's a common misconception that the weak force is responsible for *all* nuclear decays. That's not the case; the weak force GOVERNS beta decays and electron capture, but not alpha, gamma, etc.

Yes, definitely seasonally affected. Rain events can wash a lot of surface minerals into an water reservoir. You can also get underground hydrodynamics too. for instance, it can rain at the top of a mountain. The water passes down through limetone and moves minerals into an aquifer.

Your bottled water is usually Going to be fine, for ever. There are two reasons bottled water has expiration dates: Government requires all foods to have a printed expiration or best before date. There is always a maximum date limit. It's unrelated to testing or product quality, that number is just the maximum date value from manufacturing time. The second benefit is the bottle can expire. It doesn't make the water toxic, it tastes bad. When a consumer complains that their 10 year OLD bottle of water tastes bad, the manufacturer can point to The label And say you shouldn't have drunk it. There is a minor 3rd reason: the best before date is part of an automated processing line. The date is used to identify the date of manufacturer, batch number, etc. The date is meaningless but it's cheaper to leave the machine running than to turn it off.

OP asks about engine parts and The largest parts of an engine are usually not steel (e.g. engine block, intake manifold, exhaust manifold etc) - they're cast iron or cast Aluminium.

Think of a Skyscraper collapsing. A beam snaps, then another beam, then a wall, then a WHOLE floor shears at once...the epicenter is that very first beam. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocenter) . A century ago, all you had were clocks and a needle that drew on paper to record the chaos. This is called a seismometer. A seismometer records the timestamps of each wave crest, and geologists have an understanding of how fast waves move in the ground. Using the time of the very first crest, you get a Distance away, a circle. With 2 seismometers, you get two circles, which intersect at two points. With 3 seismometers, you can rule out one point. You're left with a point. We call this the epicenter. Here is a drawing of it [https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/triangulation-locate-earthquake](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/triangulation-locate-earthquake) So it's a combination of how the Technology we HAVE ON hand works, AND how we define epicenter.

Wow, we are nearly half viral dna?! Wild. Thank you for your response

Viral DNA is integrated into our genome. It's believed that transposons, which make up about 40% of our DNA, originated or are at least are closely related to viruses. To my knowledge, transposons do not have any function, and may actually be the cause of a number of genetic diseases like hemophilia.

There's some debate as to the nature of the second explosion, the first was definitely caused by steam. Potentially the fuel could have been blasted together hard enough to create a short lived chain reaction. The consensus however appears to be that it was a hydrogen explosion. Even if we assume a short-lived chain reaction was the cause of the explosion, the fact that it's not completely clear whether it was a nuclear explosion or a hydrogen explosion indicates that the reaction was so short-lived that it doesn't really count. And again, consensus is that it was not.

By what metric? The most numerous type of Virus I'm seeing are the phages that infect a certain type of bacteria called Pelagibacterales.

I don't believe that our bodies make the entire viruses as they originally were. It's more like our bodies make the proteins that the viruses were made of, because OUR ancestors found them useful in the evolutionary sense.

Because fire is a poor metaphor- fission byproducts are not like soot that you can burn away with a hotter fire. they are unaffected by heat and neutrons from fission of fresh fuel does not Affect them either. More fission just CREATES more fission byproducts. Plus, the radioactive material AT the Chernobyl site is not even the biggest concern. A fantastic amount was blown into the sky or carried via smoke for tens of km and the whole area is contaminated. [Some people have gone prospecting with a geiger counter and straight away found tiny flecks of highly radioactive core material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-MC9VBSWa8) in the first few inches of soil downwind from Chernobyl. Ultimately, pretty much everywhere in the world got at least a trace amount of the fallout.

Do the viruses that exist in OUR DNA float about in our system, or are they merely represented in genetic code? If code, does the DNA have any function in our lives?

What you say is technically true. But I'm talking mainly of steel, which is what OPs question seemed directed at. I didn't exactly want to start listing dozens of different metals, go into ferrous or non ferrous, and then get into alloys. I just wanted to keep it simple for the OP. And steel is still considered the primary metal for most production/construction instances. it was pretty plain the type of pictures or videos OP was watching wasn't about casting, but I suppose I could have mentioned a note in MY original post I was just talking about steels specifically.

not really, SILLY news articles aside. You can just walk in. Some parts of the room are relatively safe. Like &lt;20 mSv/hr.

The reason really is because the pressure is the same inside and outside everywhere. We have baro receptors in our chest and have discomfort or pain from our ears to our toes if the pressure is out of our range. the air gets everywhere between your palm and fingers except where you're pressing on THE TABLE WITH equal pressure as atmospheric pressure. You know, by making fart noises.

What do you mean when you say “out of the solar system entirely“?

Proteins are pretty sticky (to one another) to begin with. The fact that an acid is needed to drive soy Proteins to curdle and form curds is somewhat indicative that this is a denaturing and gel forming process (as it is with caesin in cheese making)

the elephant's foot was only 700 R/hr in 2001. therefore today it is much less and would take hours to give you a lethal dose.

A few of the fuel channels had to go prompt critical to shatter. Whether the rest did is unclear.

Secondary structure is driven almost entirely by charge distribution of amino acids and the hydrogen-bonding patterns they form. Tertiary structure is driven largely by hydrophobic packing AS the chain attempts to bury the hydrophobic side chains away from the water environment. As these residues are buried new h-bonds will form as distant parts of the chain coalesce and these stabilise the structure but these bonds can't really "drive" the folding. I think most folk would regard denaturation as any process that reverses or changes the hydrophobic packing. You can just heat up proteins until all the Hydrogen bonds can't be maintained and they'll unfold/denature. But adjusting the ph to either extreme can DO this too.

Scuba diver here. The pressure change on your body is massive when diving. Every ten meters down is another atmosphere’s worth of pressure. It’s changing fast. And no, you don’t feel it. Except… in your ears and your mask. You need to yawn to equalize the pressure on both sides of your eardrum. If you can’t, stop ascending/descending and wait til you can. If YOUR mask goes above equal PRESSURE the air just blows out; if it goes low you can exhale through your nose to fix it. Also, do Not hold your breath while you ascend. The point is, you don’t feel pressure. You FEEL pressure differentials. Pressure all around you has tripled and it feels normal. The liquids and solids that make up your body don’t compress much. When pressure all around you pushes, Your body pushes right back equally. The air in your lungs is another matter. The pressure in your lungs has tripled to match and you don’t even REALIZE it. Your air tank is pressurized to a couple hundred atmospheres of pressure, regulated down to match whatever pressure you’re swimming in to ensure that you Can still inhale. But, do not hold your breath while you ascend! In theory IF you could keep holding Your breath you’d explode. In reality you’ll blow the air out long before that. If you ascend at The right speed you can exhale for a looooong time as the air in your lungs keeps expanding and expanding. Fun times!
